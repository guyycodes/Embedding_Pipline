*$%pass: You are reading this book because you want to be a healer. If you’re serious about going to medical school, then you are likely already familiar with the importance of the MCAT in medical school admissions. While the holistic review process puts additional weight on your experiences, extracurricular activities, and personal attributes, the fact remains: along with your GPA, your MCAT score remains one of the two most important components of your application portfolio—at least early in the admissions process. Each additional point you score on the MCAT pushes you in front of thousands of other students and makes you an even more attractive applicant. But the MCAT is not simply an obstacle to overcome; it is an opportunity to show schools that you will be a strong student and a future leader in medicine. We at Kaplan take our jobs very seriously and aim to help students see success not only on the MCAT, but as future physicians. We work with our learning science experts to ensure that we’re using the most up-to-date teaching techniques in our resources. Multiple members of our team hold advanced degrees in medicine or associated biomedical sciences, and are committed to the highest level of medical education. Kaplan has been working with the MCAT for over 50 years and our commitment to premed students is unﬂagging; in fact, Stanley Kaplan created this company when he had diﬃculty being accepted to medical school due to unfair quota systems that existed at the time. We stand now at the beginning of a new era in medical education. As citizens of this 21st-century world of healthcare, we are charged with creating a patient-oriented, culturally competent, cost-conscious, universally available, technically advanced, and research-focused healthcare system, run by compassionate providers. Suﬃce it to say, this is no easy task.

Knowledge of Scientiﬁc Concepts and Principles (35% of questions) 2. Scientiﬁc Reasoning and Problem-Solving (45% of questions) 3. Reasoning About the Design and Execution of Research (10% of 4. Data-Based and Statistical Reasoning (10% of questions) Let’s see how each one breaks down into more speciﬁc Test Day behaviors.
*$%pass: Note that the bullet points of speciﬁc objectives for each of the SIRS are taken directly from the Oﬃcial Guide to the MCAT Exam; the descriptions of what these behaviors mean and sample question stems, however, are written by Kaplan. Skill 1: Knowledge of Scientific Concepts and Principles is is probably the least surprising of the four SIRS; the testing of science knowledge is, aer all, one of the signature qualities of the MCAT. Skill 1 questions will require you to do the following: Recognize correct scientiﬁc principles Identify the relationships among closely related concepts Identify the relationships between diﬀerent representations of concepts (verbal, symbolic, graphic) Identify examples of observations that illustrate scientiﬁc principles Use mathematical equations to solve problems At Kaplan, we simply call these Science Knowledge or Skill 1 questions. Another way to think of Skill 1 questions is as “one-step” problems. e single step is either to realize which scientiﬁc concept the question stem is suggesting or to take the concept stated in the question stem and identify which answer choice is an accurate application of it. Skill 1 questions are particularly prominent among discrete questions (those not associated with a passage). ese questions are an opportunity to gain quick points on Test Day—if you know the science concept attached to the question, then that’s it! On Test Day, 35% of the questions in each science section will be Skill 1 Here are some sample Skill 1 question stems: How would a proponent of the James–Lange theory of emotion interpret the ﬁndings of the study cited in the passage? Which of the following most accurately describes the function of FSH in the human menstrual cycle?
*$%pass: If the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 were combined in solution, the resulting reaction would form: Ionic bonds are maintained by which of the following forces? Skill 2: Scientific Reasoning and Problem-Solving e MCAT science sections do, of course, move beyond testing straightforward science knowledge; Skill 2 questions are the most common way in which it does so. At Kaplan, we also call these Critical inking questions. Skill 2 questions will require you to do the following: Reason about scientiﬁc principles, theories, and models Analyze and evaluate scientiﬁc explanations and predictions Evaluate arguments about causes and consequences Bring together theory, observations, and evidence to draw conclusions Recognize scientiﬁc ﬁndings that challenge or invalidate a scientiﬁc theory or model Determine and use scientiﬁc formulas to solve problems Just as Skill 1 questions can be thought of as “one-step” problems, many Skill 2 questions are “two-step” problems, and more diﬃcult Skill 2 questions may require three or more steps. ese questions can require a wide spectrum of reasoning skills, including integration of multiple facts from a passage, combination of multiple science content areas, and prediction of an experiment’s results. Skill 2 questions also tend to ask about science content without actually mentioning it by name. For example, a question might describe the results of one experiment and ask you to predict the results of a second experiment without actually telling you what underlying scientiﬁc principles are at work—part of the question’s diﬃculty will be ﬁguring out which principles to apply in order to get the correct answer. On Test Day, 45% of the questions in each science section will be Skill 2 questions. Here are some sample Skill 2 question stems: Which of the following experimental conditions would most likely yield results similar to those in Figure 2?
*$%pass: All of the following conclusions are supported by the information in the passage EXCEPT: e most likely cause of the anomalous results found by the An impact to a person’s chest quickly reduces the volume of one of the lungs to 70% of its initial value while not allowing any air to escape from the mouth. By what percentage is the force of outward air pressure increased on a 2 cm2 portion of the inner surface of the Skill 3: Reasoning About the Design and Execution of Research e MCAT is interested in your ability to critically appraise and analyze research, as this is an important day-to-day task of a physician. We call these questions Skill 3 or Experimental and Research Design questions for short. Skill 3 questions will require you to do the following: Identify the role of theory, past ﬁndings, and observations in scientiﬁc Identify testable research questions and hypotheses Distinguish between samples and populations and distinguish results that support generalizations about populations Identify independent and dependent variables Reason about the features of research studies that suggest associations between variables or causal relationships between them (such as temporality and random assignment) Identify conclusions that are supported by research results Determine the implications of results for real-world situations Reason about ethical issues in scientiﬁc research Over the years, the AAMC has received input from medical schools to require more practical research skills of MCAT test takers, and Skill 3 questions are the response to these demands. is skill is unique in that the outside knowledge you need to answer Skill 3 questions is not taught in any one undergraduate course; instead, the research design principles needed to answer these questions are learned gradually throughout your science classes and especially through any laboratory work you have completed.
*$%pass: It should be noted that Skill 3 comprises 10% of the questions in each science section on Test Day. Here are some sample Skill 3 question stems: What is the dependent variable in the study described in the passage? e major ﬂaw in the method used to measure disease susceptibility in Experiment 1 is: Which of the following procedures is most important for the experimenters to follow in order for their study to maintain a proper, randomized sample of research subjects? A researcher would like to test the hypothesis that individuals who move to an urban area during adulthood are more likely to own a car than are those who have lived in an urban area since birth. Which of the following studies would best test this hypothesis? Skill 4: Data-Based and Statistical Reasoning Lastly, the science sections of the MCAT test your ability to analyze the visual and numerical results of experiments and studies. We call these Data and Statistical Analysis questions. Skill 4 questions will require you to do the Use, analyze, and interpret data in ﬁgures, graphs, and tables Evaluate whether representations make sense for particular scientiﬁc observations and data Use measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (range, interquartile range, and standard deviation) to describe data Reason about random and systematic error Reason about statistical signiﬁcance and uncertainty (interpreting statistical signiﬁcance levels and interpreting a conﬁdence interval) Use data to explain relationships between variables or make Use data to answer research questions and draw conclusions Skill 4 is included in the MCAT because physicians and researchers spend much of their time examining the results of their own studies and the studies of others, and it’s very important for them to make legitimate conclusions and sound judgments based on that data.
*$%pass: e MCAT tests Skill 4 on all three science sections with graphical representations of data (charts and bar graphs), as well as numerical ones (tables, lists, and results summarized in sentence or paragraph form). On Test Day, 10% of the questions in each science section will be Skill 4 questions. Here are some sample Skill 4 question stems: According to the information in the passage, there is an inverse What conclusion is best supported by the ﬁndings displayed in Figure A medical test for a rare type of heavy metal poisoning returns a positive result for 98% of aﬀected individuals and 13% of unaﬀected individuals. Which of the following types of errors is most prevalent in If a fourth trial of Experiment 1 was run and yielded a result of 54% compliance, which of the following would be true? Discussing the SIRS tested on the MCAT is a daunting prospect given that the very nature of the skills tends to make the conversation rather abstract. Nevertheless, with enough practice, you’ll be able to identify each of the four skills quickly, and you’ll also be able to apply the proper strategies to solve those problems on Test Day. If you need a quick reference to remind you of the four SIRS, these guidelines may help: Skill 1 (Science Knowledge) questions ask: Do you remember this science content? Skill 2 (Critical inking) questions ask: Do you remember this science content? And if you do, could you please apply it to this novel situation? Could you answer this question that cleverly combines multiple content areas at the same time? Skill 3 (Experimental and Research Design) questions ask: Let’s forget about the science content for a while.
*$%pass: Could you give some insight into the experimental or research methods involved in this Skill 4 (Data and Statistical Analysis) questions ask: Let’s forget about the science content for a while. Could you accurately read some graphs and tables for a moment? Could you make some conclusions or extrapolations based on the information presented? Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS) e Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS) section of the MCAT tests three discrete families of textual reasoning skills; each of these families requires a higher level of reasoning than the last. ose three skills are as 1. Foundations of Comprehension (30% of questions) 2. Reasoning Within the Text (30% of questions) 3. Reasoning Beyond the Text (40% of questions) ese three skills are tested through nine humanities- and social sciences- themed passages, with approximately 5 to 7 questions per passage. Let’s take a more in-depth look into these three skills. Again, the bullet points of speciﬁc objectives for each of the CARS are taken directly from the Oﬃcial Guide to the MCAT Exam; the descriptions of what these behaviors mean and sample question stems, however, are written by Kaplan. Foundations of Comprehension Questions in this skill will ask for basic facts and simple inferences about the passage; the questions themselves will be similar to those seen on reading comprehension sections of other standardized exams like the SAT® and ACT®.
*$%pass: Foundations of Comprehension questions will require you to do the Understand the basic components of the text Infer meaning from rhetorical devices, word choice, and text structure is admittedly covers a wide range of potential question types including Main Idea, Detail, Inference, and Deﬁnition-in-Context questions, but ﬁnding the correct answer to all Foundations of Comprehension questions will follow from a basic understanding of the passage and the point of view of its author (and occasionally that of other voices in the passage). Here are some sample Foundations of Comprehension question stems: Main Idea—e author’s primary purpose in this passage is: Detail—Based on the information in the second paragraph, which of the following is the most accurate summary of the opinion held by (Scattered) Detail—According to the passage, which of the following is FALSE about literary reviews in the 1920s? Inference (Implication)—Which of the following phrases, as used in the passage, is most suggestive that the author has a personal bias toward narrative records of history? Inference (Assumption)—In putting together the argument in the passage, the author most likely assumes: Deﬁnition-in-Context—e word “obscure” (paragraph 3), when used in reference to the historian’s actions, most nearly means: Reasoning Within the Text While Foundations of Comprehension questions will usually depend on interpreting a single piece of information in the passage or understanding the passage as a whole, Reasoning Within the Text questions require more thought because they will ask you to identify the purpose of a particular piece of information in the context of the passage, or ask how one piece of information relates to another.
*$%pass: Reasoning Within the Text questions will require you to: Integrate diﬀerent components of the text to draw relevant conclusions e CARS section will also ask you to judge certain parts of the passage or even judge the author. ese questions, which fall under the Reasoning Within the Text skill, can ask you to identify authorial bias, evaluate the credibility of cited sources, determine the logical soundness of an argument, identify the importance of a particular fact or statement in the context of the passage, or search for relevant evidence in the passage to support a given conclusion. In all, this category includes Function and Strengthen–Weaken (Within the Passage) questions, as well as a smattering of related—but rare Here are some sample Reasoning Within the Text question stems: Function—e author’s discussion of the eﬀect of socioeconomic status on social mobility primarily serves which of the following Strengthen–Weaken (Within the Passage)—Which of the following facts is used in the passage as the most prominent piece of Passage)—Based on the role it plays in the author’s argument, e Possessed can be considered: Reasoning Beyond the Text e distinguishing factor of Reasoning Beyond the Text questions is in the title of the skill: the word Beyond. Questions that test this skill, which make up a larger share of the CARS section than questions from either of the other two skills, will always introduce a completely new situation that was not present in the passage itself; these questions will ask you to determine how one inﬂuences the other.
*$%pass: Reasoning Beyond the Text questions will require you to: Apply or extrapolate ideas from the passage to new contexts Assess the impact of introducing new factors, information, or conditions to ideas from the passage e Reasoning Beyond the Text skill is further divided into Apply and Strengthen–Weaken (Beyond the Passage) questions, and a few other rarely appearing question types. Here are some sample Reasoning Beyond the Text question stems: Apply—If a document were located that demonstrated Berlioz intended to include a chorus of at least 700 in his Grande Messe des Morts, how would the author likely respond? Apply—Which of the following is the best example of a “virtuous rebellion,” as it is deﬁned in the passage? Strengthen–Weaken (Beyond the Passage)—Suppose Jane Austen had written in a letter to her sister, “My strongest characters were those forced by circumstance to confront basic questions about the society in which they lived.” What relevance would this have to the Strengthen–Weaken (Beyond the Passage)—Which of the following sentences, if added to the end of the passage, would most WEAKEN the author’s conclusions in the last paragraph? rough the Foundations of Comprehension skill, the CARS section tests many of the reading skills you have been building on since grade school, albeit in the context of very challenging doctorate-level passages. But through the two other skills (Reasoning Within the Text and Reasoning Beyond the Text), the MCAT demands that you understand the deep structure of passages and the arguments within them at a very advanced level. And, of course, all of this is tested under very tight timing restrictions: only 102 seconds per question—and that doesn’t even include the time spent reading the passages.
*$%pass: Here’s a quick reference guide to the three CARS skills: Foundations of Comprehension questions ask: Did you understand the passage and its main ideas? What does the passage have to say about this particular detail? What must be true that the author did not say? Reasoning Within the Text questions ask: What’s the logical relationship between these two ideas from the How well argued is the author’s thesis? Reasoning Beyond the Text questions ask: How does this principle from the passage apply to this new situation? How does this new piece of information inﬂuence the arguments in Each of the four sections of the MCAT is scored between 118 and 132, with the median at approximately 125. is means the total score ranges from 472 to 528, with the median at about 500. Why such peculiar numbers? e AAMC stresses that this scale emphasizes the importance of the central portion of the score distribution, where most students score (around 125 per section, or 500 total), rather than putting undue focus on the high end of the Note that there is no wrong answer penalty on the MCAT, so you should select an answer for every question—even if it is only a guess. e AAMC has released the 2018–2020 correlation between scaled score and percentile, as shown on the following page. It should be noted that the percentile scale is adjusted and renormalized over time and thus can shi slightly from year to year. Percentile rank updates are released by the AAMC around May 1 of each year. Source: AAMC. 2021. Summary of MCAT Total and Section Scores.

*$%pass: MCAT Policies and Procedures We strongly encourage you to download the latest copy of MCAT® Essentials, available on the AAMC’s website, to ensure that you have the latest information about registration and Test Day policies and procedures; this document is updated annually. A brief summary of some of the most important rules is provided here. e only way to register for the MCAT is online. You can access AAMC’s registration system at www.aamc.org/mcat. You will be able to access the site approximately six months before Test Day. e AAMC designates three registration “Zones”—Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Registering during the Gold Zone (from the opening of registration until approximately one month before Test Day) provides the most ﬂexibility and lowest test fees. e Silver Zone runs until approximately two to three weeks before Test Day and has less ﬂexibility and higher fees; the Bronze Zone runs until approximately one to two weeks before Test Day and has the least ﬂexibility and highest fees. Fees and the Fee Assistance Program (FAP) Payment for test registration must be made by MasterCard or VISA. As described earlier, the fees for registering for the MCAT—as well as rescheduling the exam or changing your testing center—increase as one approaches Test Day. In addition, it is not uncommon for test centers to ﬁll up well in advance of the registration deadline. For these reasons, we recommend identifying your preferred Test Day as soon as possible and registering. ere are ancillary beneﬁts to having a set Test Day, as well: when you know the date you’re working toward, you’ll study harder and are less likely to keep pushing back the exam.
*$%pass: e AAMC oﬀers a Fee Assistance Program (FAP) for students with ﬁnancial hardship to help reduce the cost of taking the MCAT, as well as for the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS®) www.aamc.org/students/applying/fap. On Test Day, you will be required to present a qualifying form of ID. Generally, a current driver’s license or United States passport will be suﬃcient (consult the AAMC website for the full list of qualifying criteria). When registering, take care to spell your ﬁrst and last names (middle names, suﬃxes, and preﬁxes are not required and will not be veriﬁed on Test Day) precisely the same as they appear on this ID; failure to provide this ID at the test center or diﬀerences in spelling between your registration and ID will be considered a “no-show,” and you will not receive a refund for the exam. During Test Day registration, other identity data collected may include: a digital palm vein scan, a Test Day photo, a digitization of your valid ID, and signatures. Some testing centers may use a metal detection wand to ensure that no prohibited items are brought into the testing room. Prohibited items include all electronic devices, including watches and timers, calculators, cell phones, and any and all forms of recording equipment; food, drinks (including water), and cigarettes or other smoking paraphernalia; hats and scarves (except for religious purposes); and books, notes, or other study materials. If you require a medical device, such as an insulin pump or pacemaker, you must apply for accommodated testing. During breaks, you are allowed access to food and drink, but not to electronic devices, including Testing centers are under video surveillance and the AAMC does not take potential violations of testing security lightly. e bottom line: know the rules and don’t break them.
*$%pass: Students with disabilities or medical conditions can apply for accommodated testing. Documentation of the disability or condition is required, and requests may take two months—or more—to be approved. For this reason, it is recommended that you begin the process of applying for accommodated testing as early as possible. More information on applying for accommodated testing can be found at After Your Test When your MCAT is all over, no matter how you feel you did, be good to yourself when you leave the test center. Celebrate! Take a nap. Watch a movie. Get some exercise. Plan a trip or outing. Call up all of your neglected friends or message them on social media. Go out for snacks or drinks with people you like. Whatever you do, make sure that it has absolutely nothing to do with thinking too hard—you deserve some rest and relaxation. Perhaps most importantly, do not discuss speciﬁc details about the test with anyone. For one, it is important to let go of the stress of Test Day, and reliving your exam only inhibits you from being able to do so. But more signiﬁcantly, the Examinee Agreement you sign at the beginning of your exam speciﬁcally prohibits you from discussing or disclosing exam content. e AAMC is known to seek out individuals who violate this agreement and retains the right to prosecute these individuals at their discretion. is means that you should not, under any individuals—including us at Kaplan— or post information or questions about exam content to Facebook, Student Doctor Network, or other online social media. You are permitted to comment on your “general exam experience,” including how you felt about the exam overall or an individual section, but this is a ﬁne line.
*$%pass: In summary: if you’re not certain whether you can discuss an aspect of the test or not, just don’t do it! Do not let a silly Facebook post stop you from becoming the doctor you deserve to be. Scores are typically released approximately one month aer Test Day. e release is staggered during the aernoon and evening, ending at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. is means that not all examinees receive their scores at exactly the same time. Your score report will include a scaled score for each section between 118 and 132, as well as your total combined score between 472 and 528. ese scores are given as conﬁdence intervals. For each section, the conﬁdence interval is approximately the given score ±1; for the total score, it is approximately the given score ±2. You will also be given the corresponding percentile rank for each of these section scores and the AAMC Contact Information For further questions, contact the MCAT team at the Association of American Medical Colleges: MCAT Resource Center Association of American Medical Colleges The Kaplan MCAT Review project began shortly after the release of the Preview Guide for the MCAT 2015 Exam, 2nd edition. Through thorough analysis by our staff psychometricians, we were able to analyze the relative yield of the different topics on the MCAT, and we began constructing tables of contents for the books of the Kaplan MCAT Review series. A dedicated staff of 30 writers, 7 editors, and 32 proofreaders worked over 5,000 combined hours to produce these books. The format of the books was heavily influenced by weekly meetings with Kaplan’s learning science In the years since this book was created, a number of opportunities for expansion and improvement have occurred.
*$%pass: The current edition represents the culmination of the wisdom accumulated during that time frame, and it also includes several new features designed to improve the reading and learning experience in these texts.

At the beginning of each section, you’ll ﬁnd a short list of objectives describing the skills covered within that section.
*$%pass: Learning objectives for these texts were developed in conjunction with Kaplan’s learning science team, and have been designed speciﬁcally to focus your attention on tasks and concepts that are likely to show up on your MCAT. ese learning objectives will function as a means to guide your study, and indicate what information and relationships you should be focused on within each section. Before starting each section, read these learning objectives carefully. ey will not only allow you to assess your existing familiarity with the content, but also provide a goal-oriented focus for your studying experience of the MCAT Concept Checks At the end of each section, you’ll ﬁnd a few open-ended questions that you can use to assess your mastery of the material. ese MCAT Concept Checks were introduced aer numerous conversations with Kaplan’s learning science team. Research has demonstrated repeatedly that introspection and self-analysis improve mastery, retention, and recall of material. Complete these MCAT Concept Checks to ensure that you’ve got the key points from each section before moving on! Science Mastery Assessments At the beginning of each chapter, you’ll ﬁnd 15 MCAT-style practice questions. ese are designed to help you assess your understanding of the chapter before you begin reading the chapter. Using the guidance provided with the assessment, you can determine the best way to review each chapter based on your personal strengths and weaknesses. Most of the questions in the Science Mastery Assessments focus on the ﬁrst of the Scientiﬁc Inquiry and Reasoning Skills (Knowledge of Scientiﬁc Concepts and Principles), although there are occasional questions that fall into the second or fourth SIRS (Scientiﬁc Reasoning and Problem-Solving and Data-Based and Statistical Reasoning, respectively).
*$%pass: In addition, in your online resources you’ll ﬁnd a test-like passage set covering the same content you just studied to ensure you can also apply your knowledge the way the MCAT will expect Guided Examples with Expert Thinking Embedded in each chapter of this book is a Guided Example with Expert inking. ese examples will be located adjacent to the content that they are related to, and contain an MCAT-like scientiﬁc article as a passage. Read through the passage as you would on the real MCAT, referring to the Expert inking material on the right to clarify the key information you should be gathering from each passage. Read and attempt to answer the associated question once you have worked through the passage. ere is a full explanation, including the correct answer, following the question given. ese passages and questions are designed to help build your critical thinking, experimental reasoning, and data interpretation skills as preparation for the challenges you will face on the MCAT. e following is a guide to the ﬁve types of sidebars you’ll ﬁnd in Kaplan MCAT Biology Review: Bridge: ese sidebars create connections between science topics that appear in multiple chapters throughout the Kaplan MCAT Review Key Concept: ese sidebars draw attention to the most important takeaways in a given topic, and they sometimes oﬀer synopses or overviews of complex information. If you understand nothing else, make sure you grasp the Key Concepts for any given subject. MCAT Expertise: ese sidebars point out how information may be tested on the MCAT or oﬀer key strategy points and test-taking tips that you should apply on Test Day.
*$%pass: Mnemonic: ese sidebars present memory devices to help recall Real World: ese sidebars illustrate how a concept in the text relates to the practice of medicine or the world at large. While this is not information you need to know for Test Day, many of the topics in Real World sidebars are excellent examples of how a concept may appear in a passage or discrete (stand-alone) question on the MCAT. What This Book Covers e information presented in the Kaplan MCAT Review series covers everything listed on the oﬃcial MCAT content lists. Every topic in these lists is covered in the same level of detail as is common to the undergraduate and postbaccalaureate classes that are considered prerequisites for the MCAT. Note that your premedical classes may include topics not discussed in these books, or they may go into more depth than these books do. Additional exposure to science content is never a bad thing, but all of the content knowledge you are expected to have walking in on Test Day is covered in Chapter Proﬁles, on the ﬁrst page of each chapter, represent a holistic look at the content within the chapter, and will include a pie chart as well as text information. e pie chart analysis is based directly on data released by the AAMC, and will give a rough estimate of the importance of the chapter in relation to the book as a whole. Further, the text portion of the Chapter Proﬁles includes which AAMC content categories are covered within the chapter. ese are referenced directly from the AAMC MCAT exam content listing, available on the testmaker’s website.

We look forward to working with you as you achieve your dreams and become the doctor you deserve to be! Studying with This Book In addition to providing you with the best practice questions and test strategies, Kaplan’s team of learning scientists are dedicated to researching and testing the best methods for getting the most out of your study time. Here are their top four tips for improving retention: Review multiple topics in one study session. is may seem counterintuitive—we’re used to practicing one skill at a time in order to improve each skill. But research shows that weaving topics together leads to increased learning. Beyond that consideration, the MCAT oen includes more than one topic in a single question.
*$%pass: Studying in an integrated manner is the most eﬀective way to prepare for this test. Customize the content. Drawing attention to diﬃcult or critical content can ensure you don’t overlook it as you read and re-read sections. e best way to do this is to make it more visual—highlight, make tabs, use stickies, whatever works. We recommend highlighting only the most important or diﬃcult sections of text. Selective highlighting of up to about 10% of text in a given chapter is great for emphasizing parts of the text, but over- highlighting can have the opposite eﬀect. Repeat topics over time. Many people try to memorize concepts by repeating them over and over again in succession. Our research shows that retention is improved by spacing out the repeats over time and mixing up the order in which you study content. For example, try reading chapters in a diﬀerent order the second (or third!) time around. Revisit practice questions that you answered incorrectly in a new sequence. Perhaps information you reviewed more recently will help you better understand those questions and solutions you struggled with in the past. Take a moment to reﬂect. When you ﬁnish reading a section for the ﬁrst time, stop and think about what you just read. Jot down a few thoughts in the margins or in your notes about why the content is important or what topics came to mind when you read it. Associating learning with a memory is a fantastic way to retain information! is also works when answering questions. Aer answering a question, take a moment to think through each step you took to arrive at a solution. What led you to the answer you chose? Understanding the steps you took will help you make good decisions when answering future questions.

Studying for the MCAT The first year of medical school is a frenzied experience for most students. To meet the requirements of a rigorous work schedule, students either learn to prioritize their time or else fall hopelessly behind. It’s no surprise, then, that the MCAT, the test specifically designed to predict success in medical school, is a high-speed, time-intensive test. The MCAT demands excellent time-management skills, endurance, and grace under pressure both during the test as well as while preparing for it. Having a solid plan of attack and sticking with it are key to giving you the confidence and structure you need Creating a Study Plan The best time to create a study plan is at the beginning of your MCAT preparation. If you don’t already use a calendar, you will want to start. You can purchase a planner, print out a free calendar from the Internet, use a built-in calendar or app on one of your smart devices, or keep track using an interactive online calendar. Pick the option that is most practical for you and that you are most likely to use consistently. Once you have a calendar, you’ll be able to start planning your study schedule with the following steps: 1. Fill in your obligations and choose a day off. Write in all your school, extracurricular, and work obligations first: class sessions, work shifts, and meetings that you must attend. Then add in your personal obligations: appointments, lunch dates, family and social time, etc.
*$%pass: Making an appointment in your calendar for hanging out with friends or going to the movies may seem strange at first, but planning social activities in advance will help you achieve a balance between personal and professional obligations even as life gets busy. Having a happy balance allows you to be more focused and productive when it comes time to study, so stay well-rounded and don’t neglect anything that is important to you. In addition to scheduling your personal and professional obligations, you should also plan your time off. Taking some time off is just as important as studying. Kaplan recommends taking at least one full day off per week, ideally from all your study obligations but at minimum from studying for the MCAT. 2. Add in study blocks around your obligations. Once you have established your calendar’s framework, add in study blocks around your obligations, keeping your study schedule as consistent as possible across days and across weeks. Studying at the same time of day as your official test is ideal for promoting recall, but if that’s not possible, then fit in study blocks wherever you can. To make your studying as efficient as possible, block out short, frequent periods of study time throughout the week. From a learning perspective, studying one hour per day for six days per week is much more valuable than studying for six hours all at once one day per week. Specifically, Kaplan recommends studying for no longer than three hours in one sitting. Within those three-hour blocks, also plan to take ten-minute breaks every hour. Use these breaks to get up from your seat, do some quick stretches, get a snack and drink, and clear your mind.
*$%pass: Although ten minutes of break for every 50 minutes of studying may sound like a lot, these breaks will allow you to deal with distractions and rest your brain so that, during the 50-minute study blocks, you can remain fully engaged and completely focused. 3. Add in your full-length practice tests. Next, you’ll want to add in full-length practice tests. You’ll want to take one test very early in your prep and then spread your remaining full-length practice tests evenly between now and your test date. Staggering tests in this way allows you to form a baseline for comparison and to determine which areas to focus on right away, while also providing realistic feedback throughout your prep as to how you will perform on Test Day. When planning your calendar, aim to finish your full-length practice tests and the majority of your studying by one week before Test Day, which will allow you to spend that final week completing a final, brief review of what you already know. In your online resources, you’ll find sample study calendars for several different Test Day timelines to use as a starting point. The sample calendars may include more focus than you need in some areas, and less in others, and it may not fit your timeline to Test Day. You will need to customize your study calendar to your needs using the steps above. The total amount of time you spend studying each week will depend on your schedule, your personal prep needs, and your time to Test Day, but it is recommended that you spend somewhere in the range of 300–350 hours preparing before taking the official MCAT.
*$%pass: One way you could break this down is to study for three hours per day, six days per week, for four months, but this is just one approach. You might study six days per week for more than three hours per day. You might study over a longer period of time if you don’t have much time to study each week. No matter what your plan is, ensure you complete enough practice to feel completely comfortable with the MCAT and its content. A good sign you’re ready for Test Day is when you begin to earn your goal score consistently in practice. How to Study The MCAT covers a large amount of material, so studying for Test Day can initially seem daunting. To combat this, we have some tips on how to take control of your studying and make the most of your time. To take control of the amount of content and practice required to do well on the MCAT, break the content down into specific goals for each week instead of attempting to approach the test as a whole. A goal of “I want to increase my overall score by 5 points” is too big, abstract, and difficult to measure on the small scale. More reasonable goals are “I will read two chapters each day this week.” Goals like this are much less overwhelming and help break studying into manageable pieces. As you go through this book, much of the information will be familiar to you. After all, you have probably seen most of the content before. However, be very careful: Familiarity with a subject does not necessarily translate to knowledge or mastery of that subject. Do not assume that if you recognize a concept you actually know it and can apply it quickly at an appropriate level.
*$%pass: Don’t just passively read this book. Instead, read actively: Use the free margin space to jot down important ideas, draw diagrams, and make charts as you read. Highlighting can be an excellent tool, but use it sparingly: highlighting every sentence isn’t active reading, it’s coloring. Frequently stop and ask yourself questions while you read (e.g., What is the main point? How does this fit into the overall scheme of things? Could I thoroughly explain this to someone else?). By making connections and focusing on the grander scheme, not only will you ensure you know the essential content, but you also prepare yourself for the level of critical thinking required by the MCAT. Focus on Areas of Greatest Opportunity If you are limited by only having a minimal amount of time to prepare before Test Day, focus on your biggest areas of opportunity first. Areas of opportunity are topic areas that are highly tested and that you have not yet mastered. You likely won’t have time to take detailed notes for every page of these books; instead, use your results from practice materials to determine which areas are your biggest opportunities and seek those out. After you’ve taken a full-length test, make sure you are using your performance report to best identify areas of opportunity. Skim over content matter for which you are already demonstrating proficiency, pausing to read more thoroughly when something looks unfamiliar or particularly difficult. Begin with the Science Mastery Assessment at the beginning of each chapter.
*$%pass: If you can get all of those questions correct within a reasonable amount of time, you may be able to quickly skim through that chapter, but if the questions prove to be more difficult, then you may need to spend time reading the chapter or certain subsections of the chapter more thoroughly. Practice, Review, and Tracking Leave time to review your practice questions and full-length tests. You may be tempted, after practicing, to push ahead and cover new material as quickly as possible, but failing to schedule ample time for review will actually throw away your greatest opportunity to improve your performance. The brain rarely remembers anything it sees or does only once. When you carefully review the questions you’ve solved (and the explanations for them), the process of retrieving that information reopens and reinforces the connections you’ve built in your brain. This builds long- term retention and repeatable skill sets—exactly what you need to beat the While reviewing, take notes about the specific reasons why you missed questions you got wrong or had to guess on, perhaps by using a spreadsheet like the one below. Keep adding to the same Why I Missed It Sheet (WIMIS) as you complete more practice questions, and periodically review your WIMIS to identify any patterns you see, such as consistently missing questions in certain content areas or falling for the same testmaker traps. As you move through your MCAT prep, adjust your study plan based on your available study time and the results of your review. Your strengths and weaknesses are likely to change over the course of your prep. Keep addressing the areas that are most important to your score, shifting your focus as those areas change.
*$%pass: For more help with reviewing and making the most of your full-length tests, including a WIMIS template, make sure to check out the videos and resources in your online syllabus. Why I missed it Chem/Phys 42 Nuclear Confused electron absorption Chem/Phys 47 Keq Miscalculation Need to memorize equation Didn’t read “not” in answer choice; slow down! Out of Scope Forgot to research answer Where to Study One often-overlooked aspect of studying is the environment where the learning actually occurs. Although studying at home is many students’ first choice, several problems can arise in this environment, chief of which are distractions. Studying can be a mentally draining process, so as time passes, these distractions become ever more tempting as escape routes. Although you may have considerable willpower, there’s no reason to make staying focused harder than it needs to be. Instead of studying at home, head to a library, quiet coffee shop, or another new location whenever possible. This will eliminate many of the usual distractions and also promote efficient studying; instead of studying off and on at home over the course of an entire day, you can stay at the library for three hours of effective studying and enjoy the rest of the day off from the MCAT. No matter where you study, make your practice as much like Test Day as possible. Just as is required during the official test, don’t have snacks or chew gum during your study blocks. Turn off your music, television, and phone. Practice on the computer with your online resources to simulate the computer-based test environment. When completing practice questions, do your work on scratch paper or noteboard sheets rather than writing directly on any printed materials since you won’t have that option on Test Day.
*$%pass: Because memory is tied to all of your senses, the more test-like you can make your studying environment, the easier it will be on Test Day to recall the information you’re putting in so much work to learn. Chapter 1 The Cell Chapter 1: The Cell with organelles of the cell in the Science Mastery Assessment Every pre-med knows this feeling: there is so much content I have to know for the MCAT! How do I know what to do first or what’s important? While the high-yield badges throughout this book will help you identify the most important topics, this Science Mastery Assessment is another tool in your MCAT prep arsenal. This quiz (which can also be taken in your online resources) and the guidance below will help ensure that you are spending the appropriate amount of time on this chapter based on your personal strengths and weaknesses. Don’t worry though—skipping something now does not mean you’ll never study it. Later on in your prep, as you complete full-length tests, you’ll uncover specific pieces of content that you need to review and can come back to these chapters as appropriate. How to Use This Assessment If you answer 0–7 questions correctly: Spend about 1 hour to read this chapter in full and take limited notes throughout. Follow up by reviewing all quiz questions to ensure that you now understand how to solve each one. If you answer 8–11 questions correctly: Spend 20–40 minutes reviewing the quiz questions. Beginning with the questions you missed, read and take notes on the corresponding subchapters. For questions you answered correctly, ensure your thinking matches that of the explanation and you understand why each choice was correct or incorrect.
*$%pass: If you answer 12–15 questions correctly: Spend less than 20 minutes reviewing all questions from the quiz. If you missed any, then include a quick read-through of the corresponding subchapters, or even just the relevant content within a subchapter, as part of your question review. For questions you answered correctly, ensure your thinking matches that of the explanation and review the Concept Summary at the end of the chapter. 1.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content categories: 1D: Principles of bioenergetics and fuel molecule metabolism 2A: Assemblies of molecules, cells, and groups of cells within single cellular and 2B: The structure, growth, physiology, and genetics of prokaryotes and viruses The human body contains approximately 37 trillion cells, with bacterial cells outnumbering the eukaryotic cells by about 10 to 1.
*$%pass: Our cells create tissues that form organs, and each cell serves a purpose, communicating and carrying out the reactions that make life possible. The sheer number of cells that make up the human body is not nearly as impressive as the numerous functions these cells can perform—from the conduction of impulses through the nervous system that allows for memory and learning, to the simultaneous contraction of cardiac myocytes that pump blood through the entire human body. In order to understand the human organism as a whole and how the human body reacts to various pathogens, a thorough understanding of cell biology is required. It is not enough to simply memorize each part of the cell; the MCAT requires an understanding of how each cell structure carries out its functions and affects the entire organism. This chapter represents 18% of all biology questions you would see on Test Day. That makes the cell, specifically eukaryotic cell structure and function, one of the single highest-yield subjects within any of the review books. Make sure to work sufficient study of these materials into your study plan. After Chapter 1.1, you will be able to: Recall the four fundamental tenets of cell theory Robert Hooke, who invented the first crude microscopes to look at cork, is also known for his characterization of springs. Hooke’s law, F = –kx, describes the relationship between elastic force, the spring constant, and the displacement of a spring from equilibrium. While Hooke’s law does not appear on the official MCAT content lists, the related topic of elastic potential energy, , is testable content. This equation and other forms of energy are discussed in Chapter 2 of MCAT Physics and Math Review. Prior to the 1600s, organisms were perceived as being complete and inseparable into smaller parts.
*$%pass: This was due in part to the inability to see smaller structures through simple optical instruments like magnifying glasses. In 1665, Robert Hooke assembled a crude compound microscope and tested its properties on a piece of cork. He noticed a honeycomb-like structure and compared the spaces within the cork to the small rooms of a monastery, known as cells. Because cork consists of desiccated nonliving cells, Hooke was not able to see nuclei, organelles, or cell membranes. In 1674, Anton van Leeuwenhoek was the first to view a living cell under a microscope. Later researchers noted that cells could be separated, and that each cell was a distinct structure. Further research indicated that tissues were made of cells, and the function of a tissue was dependent upon the function of the cells that make up the tissue. Two centuries later, in 1850, Rudolph Virchow demonstrated that diseased cells could arise from normal cells in normal tissues. The original form of the cell theory consisted of three basic tenets: All living things are composed of cells. The cell is the basic functional unit of life. Cells arise only from preexisting cells. Through advances in molecular biology, a fourth tenet has been added to the theory: Cells carry genetic information in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This genetic material is passed on from parent to daughter cell. Cell theory has created an interesting dilemma with respect to viruses. Viruses are small structures that contain genetic material, but are unable to reproduce on their own. This violates the third and fourth tenets of the cell theory because virions can only replicate by invading other organisms and because they may use ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic information. Therefore, viruses, discussed later in this chapter, are not considered living organisms.
*$%pass: MCAT Concept Check1.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with this question. 1. What are the four fundamental tenets of the cell theory? Solutions to concept checks for a given chapter in MCAT Biology Review can be found near the end of the chapter in which the concept check is located, following the Concept Summary for that chapter. 1.2Eukaryotic Cells High-Yield After Chapter 1.2, you will be able to: Explain the importance of hydrogen peroxide to cellular function Identify the predominant proteins found in microfilaments, microtubules, and Distinguish between the properties of different cytoskeletal structures Classify cell types as epithelial or connective tissue Recall the names and functions of cellular organelles: eukaryotic cell with organelles The first major distinction we can make between living organisms is whether they are composed of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms are always single celled, while eukaryotic organisms can be unicellular or multicellular. Whereas eukaryotic cells contain a true nucleus enclosed in a membrane, prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus. The major organelles are identified in the eukaryotic cell in cell with organelles described in this chapter labeled Figure 1.1 Eukaryotic Cell Numerous membrane-bound organelles are found in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. The “High-Yield” badge on this section indicates that the content is frequently tested on Each cell has a membrane enclosing a semifluid cytosol in which the organelles are suspended. In eukaryotic cells, most organelles are membrane bound, allowing for compartmentalization of functions. Membranes of eukaryotic cells consist of a phospholipid bilayer.
*$%pass: This membrane is unique in that its surfaces are hydrophilic, electrostatically interacting with the aqueous environments inside and outside of the cell, while its inner portion is hydrophobic, which helps to provide a highly selective barrier between the interior of the cell and the external environment. The cell membrane is such an important topic on the MCAT that an entire chapter—Chapter 8 of MCAT Biochemistry Review—is devoted solely to discussing the structure and physiology of biological membranes. The cytosol allows for the diffusion of molecules throughout the cell. Within the nucleus, genetic material is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is organized into chromosomes. Eukaryotic cells reproduce by mitosis, allowing for the formation of two identical daughter cells. As the control center of the cell, the nucleus is the most heavily tested organelle on the MCAT. It contains all of the genetic material necessary for replication of the cell. The nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear membrane or envelope, a double membrane that maintains a nuclear environment separate and distinct from the cytoplasm. Nuclear pores in the nuclear membrane allow selective two-way exchange of material between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The nuclear envelope creates two distinct environments within the cell because it separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. This permits compartmentalization of transcription (the formation of hnRNA from DNA, which is subsequently processed to form mRNA) and translation (the formation of a peptide from mRNA). These processes are discussed in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. The genetic material (DNA) contains coding regions called genes. Linear DNA is wound around organizing proteins known as histones, and is then further wound into linear strands called chromosomes. The location of DNA in the nucleus permits the compartmentalization of DNA transcription separate from RNA translation.
*$%pass: Finally, there is a subsection of the nucleus known as the nucleolus, where the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized. The nucleolus actually takes up approximately 25 percent of the volume of the entire nucleus and can often be identified as a darker spot in the nucleus. Mitochondria, shown in Figure 1.2, are often called the power plants of the cell, in reference to their important metabolic functions. The mitochondrion contains two layers: the outer and inner membranes. The outer membrane serves as a barrier between the cytosol and the inner environment of the mitochondrion. The inner membrane, which is arranged into numerous infoldings called cristae, contains the molecules and enzymes of the electron transport chain. The cristae are highly convoluted structures that increase the surface area available for electron transport chain enzymes. The space between the inner and outer membranes is called the intermembrane space; the space inside the inner membrane is called the mitochondrial matrix. As described in Chapter 10 of MCAT Biochemistry Review, the pumping of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space establishes the proton-motive force; ultimately, these protons flow through ATP synthase to generate ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. matrix containing mitochondrial DNA, inner membrane with molecular complexes, and ATP being produced Figure 1.2 Mitochondrial Structure The serial endosymbiosis theory attempts to explain the formation of some of the membrane-bound organelles; it posits that these organelles formed by the engulfing of one prokaryote by another and the establishment of a symbiotic relationship. In addition to mitochondria, chloroplasts in plant cells and organelles of motility (such as flagella) are believed to have originated from this process. Mitochondria are different from other parts of the cell in that they are semi-autonomous. They contain some of their own genes and replicate independently of the nucleus via binary fission.
*$%pass: As such, they are paradigmatic examples of cytoplasmic or extranuclear inheritance—the transmission of genetic material independent of the nucleus. Mitochondria are thought to have originated when the engulfing of an aerobic prokaryote by an anaerobic prokaryote resulted in a symbiotic relationship. In addition to keeping the cell alive by providing energy, the mitochondria are also capable of killing the cell by release of enzymes from the electron transport chain. This release kick-starts a process known as apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Lysosomes are membrane-bound structures containing hydrolytic enzymes that are capable of breaking down many different substrates, including substances ingested by endocytosis and cellular waste products. Lysosomes often function in conjunction with endosomes, which transport, package and sort cell material traveling to and from the membrane. Endosomes are capable of transporting materials to the trans-golgi, to the cell membrane, or to the lysosomal pathway for degradation. The lysosomal membrane sequesters these enzymes to prevent damage to the cell. However, release of these enzymes can occur in a process known as autolysis. Like mitochondria, when lysosomes release their hydrolytic enzymes, it results in apoptosis. In this case, the released enzymes directly lead to the degradation of cellular components. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a series of interconnected membranes that are actually contiguous with the nuclear envelope. The double membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum is folded into numerous invaginations, creating complex structures with a central lumen. There are two varieties of ER: smooth and rough. The rough ER (RER) is studded with ribosomes, which permit the translation of proteins destined for secretion directly into its lumen. On the other hand, the smooth ER (SER) lacks ribosomes and is utilized primarily for lipid synthesis (such as the phospholipids in the cell membrane) and the detoxification of certain drugs and poisons.
*$%pass: The SER also transports proteins from the RER to the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus consists of stacked membrane-bound sacs. Materials from the ER are transferred to the Golgi apparatus in vesicles. Once inside the Golgi apparatus, these cellular products may be modified by the addition of groups like carbohydrates, phosphates, and sulfates. The Golgi apparatus may also modify cellular products through the introduction of signal sequences, which direct the delivery of the product to a specific cellular location. After modification and sorting in the Golgi apparatus, cellular products are repackaged in vesicles, which are then directed to the correct cellular location. If the product is destined for secretion, the secretory vesicle merges with the cell membrane and its contents are released via exocytosis. The relationships between lysosomes, the ER, and the Golgi apparatus are shown in Figure 1.3. vesicle from ER traveling to Golgi, vesicles from Golgi allowing secretion, storage, or travel to lysosomes Figure 1.3 Lysosomes, the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and the Golgi Apparatus Not all cells have the same relative distribution of organelles. Form will follow function. Cells that require a lot of energy for locomotion (such as sperm cells) have high concentrations of mitochondria. Cells involved in secretion (such as pancreatic islet cells and other endocrine tissues) have high concentrations of RER and Golgi apparatuses. Other cells, such as red blood cells, which primarily serve a transport function, have no organelles at all. Peroxisomes contain hydrogen peroxide. One of the primary functions of peroxisomes is the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids via β-oxidation. Peroxisomes participate in the synthesis of phospholipids and contain some of the enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biochemistry Review.
*$%pass: The cytoskeleton, shown in Figure 1.4, provides structure to the cell and helps it to maintain its shape. In addition, the cytoskeleton provides a conduit for the transport of materials around the cell. There are three components of the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. structure and distribution of microfilaments, microtubles, and intermediate filaments in the cell Figure 1.4 Cytoskeletal Elements The rounded shape near the center in each of these photographs is the nucleus. Microfilaments are made up of solid polymerized rods of actin. The actin filaments are organized into bundles and networks and are resistant to both compression and fracture, providing protection for the cell. Actin filaments can also use ATP to generate force for movement by interacting with myosin, such as in muscle contraction. Microfilaments also play a role in cytokinesis, or the division of materials between daughter cells. During mitosis, the cleavage furrow is formed from microfilaments, which organize as a ring at the site of division between the two new daughter cells. As the actin filaments within this ring contract, the ring becomes smaller, eventually pinching off the connection between the two daughter cells. Motor proteins like kinesin and dynein are classic examples of nonenzymatic protein function, along with binding proteins, cell adhesion molecules, immunoglobulins, and ion channels. Motor proteins often travel along cytoskeletal structures to accomplish their functions. Nonenzymatic protein functions are discussed in Chapter 3 of MCAT Unlike microfilaments, microtubules are hollow polymers of tubulin proteins. Microtubules radiate throughout the cell, providing the primary pathways along which motor proteins like kinesin and dynein carry vesicles. Cilia and flagella are motile structures composed of microtubules.
*$%pass: Cilia are projections from a cell that are primarily involved in the movement of materials along the surface of the cell; for example, cilia line the respiratory tract and are involved in the movement of mucus. Flagella are structures involved in the movement of the cell itself, such as the movement of sperm cells through the reproductive tract. Cilia and flagella share the same structure, composed of nine pairs of microtubules forming an outer ring, with two microtubules in the center, as shown in Figure 1.5. This is known as a 9 + 2 structure and is seen only in eukaryotic organelles of motility. Bacterial flagella have a different structure with a different chemical composition, as discussed later in this chapter. cross-section with doublet microtubules, central microtubules, dynein arms, plasma membrane, radial spokes, inner sheath, and nexin labeled Figure 1.5 Cilium and Flagellum Structure Microtubules are organized into a ring of 9 doublets with 2 central microtubules. Centrioles are found in a region of the cell called the centrosome. They are the organizing centers for microtubules and are structured as nine triplets of microtubules with a hollow center. During mitosis, the centrioles migrate to opposite poles of the dividing cell and organize the mitotic spindle. The microtubules emanating from the centrioles attach to the chromosomes via complexes called kinetochores and exert force on the sister chromatids, pulling them apart. Intermediate filaments are a diverse group of filamentous proteins, which includes keratin, desmin, vimentin, and lamins. Many intermediate filaments are involved in cell–cell adhesion or maintenance of the overall integrity of the cytoskeleton. Intermediate filaments are able to withstand a tremendous amount of tension, increasing the structural rigidity of the cell. In addition, intermediate filaments help anchor other organelles, including the nucleus.
*$%pass: The identity of the intermediate filament proteins within a cell is specific to the cell and tissue type. One of the unique characteristics of eukaryotic cells is the formation of tissues with division of labor, as different cells in a tissue may carry out different functions. For example, in the heart, some cells participate in the conduction pathways while others cause contraction; still others serve a supportive role like maintaining structural integrity of the organ. There are four tissue types: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. While muscle and nervous tissue are considered more extensively in subsequent chapters, we explore epithelial and connective tissues below. Epithelial tissues cover the body and line its cavities, providing a means for protection against pathogen invasion and desiccation. In certain organs, epithelial cells are involved in absorption, secretion, and sensation. To remain as one cohesive unit, epithelial cells are tightly joined to each other and to an underlying layer of connective tissue known as the basement membrane. Epithelial cells are highly diverse and serve numerous functions depending on the identity of the organ in which they are found; in most organs, epithelial cells constitute the parenchyma, or the functional parts of the organ. For example, nephrons in the kidney are composed of epithelial cells, and hepatocytes in the liver, and acid-producing cells of the stomach are epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are often polarized, meaning that one side faces a lumen (the hollow inside of an organ or tube) or the outside world, while the other side interacts with underlying blood vessels and structural cells.
*$%pass: For example, in the small intestine, one side of the cell will be involved in absorption of nutrients from the lumen, while the other side will be involved in releasing those nutrients into circulation for use in the rest of the body. We can classify different epithelia according to the number of layers they have and the shape of their cells. Simple epithelia have one layer of cells; stratified epithelia have multiple layers; and pseudostratified epithelia appear to have multiple layers due to differences in cell height but are, in reality, only one layer. Turning to shape, cells may be classified as cuboidal, columnar, or squamous. As their names imply, cuboidal cells are cube-shaped and columnar cells are long and thin. Squamous cells are flat and Connective tissue supports the body and provides a framework for the epithelial cells to carry out their functions. Whereas epithelial cells contribute to the parenchyma of an organ, connective tissues are the main contributors to the stroma or support structure. Bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood are all examples of connective tissues. Most cells in connective tissues produce and secrete materials such as collagen and elastin to form the extracellular matrix.

Prokaryotes do not contain any membrane-bound organelles, and their genetic material is organized into a single circular molecule of DNA concentrated in an area of the cell called the nucleoid region. Despite the simplicity of prokaryotes, they are incredibly diverse, and knowledge of this diversity is essential for the study of medicine because many prokaryotes can cause infection. In fact, choosing the appropriate antibiotic to fight an infection requires knowledge about the basic structure of the bacteria causing the There are three overarching domains into which all life is classified: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Two of these—Archaea and Bacteria—contain prokaryotes. Initially, Archaea and Bacteria were classified together into the kingdom of Monera. However, modern genetics and biochemical techniques have indicated that the differences in the evolutionary pathways between Archaea and Bacteria are at least as significant as between either of these domains and Eukarya. Archaea are single-celled organisms that are visually similar to bacteria, but contain genes and several metabolic pathways that are more similar to eukaryotes than to bacteria.
*$%pass: Historically, Archaea were considered extremophiles, in that they were most commonly isolated from harsh environments with extremely high temperatures, high salinity, or no light. More recent research has demonstrated a greater variety of habitats for these organisms, including the human body. Archaea are notable for their ability to use alternative sources of energy. While some are photosynthetic, many are chemosynthetic and can generate energy from inorganic compounds, including sulfur- and nitrogen-based compounds such as ammonia. Due to the similarities of this domain to eukaryotes, it is hypothesized that eukaryotes and the Archaea share a common origin. Both eukaryotes and Archaea start translation with methionine, contain similar RNA polymerases, and associate their DNA with histones. However, Archaea contain a single circular chromosome, divide by binary fission or budding, and share a similar overall structure to bacteria. Interestingly, Archaea are resistant to many antibiotics. All bacteria contain a cell membrane and cytoplasm, and some have flagella or fimbriae (similar to cilia), as shown in Figure 1.6. Because bacteria and eukaryotes often share analogous structures, it can be difficult to develop medicines that target only bacteria. However, in some cases, even seemingly similar structures have enough biochemical differences to allow the exclusive targeting of one kind of organism. For example, bacterial flagella and eukaryotic flagella are different enough that scientists are able to develop antibacterial vaccines that specifically target the bacterial flagellum. Also, many antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome, which is significantly smaller than the eukaryotic ribosome. bacilli with one long projection and many shorter projections Figure 1.6 Prokaryotic Cell Specializations: Flagella and Fimbriae Bacteria perform essential functions for human beings, including the production of vitamin K in the intestine. Vitamin K is required for production of the plasma proteins necessary for blood clotting.
*$%pass: Newborn infants are not yet colonized by bacteria and cannot produce clotting factors, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. When babies are born, they are given an injection of vitamin K to aid in the production of clotting factors until they have been colonized with bacteria. There are approximately 5 × 1030 bacteria on Earth, outnumbering all of the plants and animals combined. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, bacteria outnumber human cells in the body by 10:1. The relationship between the human body and bacteria is complex. Some bacteria are mutualistic symbiotes, meaning that both humans and the bacteria benefit from the relationship. Examples include the bacteria in the human gut that produce vitamin K and biotin (vitamin B7), and which also prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. Other bacteria are pathogens or parasites, meaning that they provide no advantage or benefit to the host, but rather cause disease. Pathogenic bacteria may live intracellularly or extracellularly. For example, Chlamydia trachomatis, a common sexually transmitted infection, lives inside cells of the reproductive tract; Clostridium tetani, the cause of tetanus, lives outside of cells and produces toxins that enter the bloodstream. Classification of Bacteria by Shape Classification of bacteria by shape provides scientists and pathologists (physicians who specialize in the identification and characterization of disease) a common language to talk about bacteria, as well as a way to identify different species of bacteria. Most bacteria exist in one of three shapes, as shown in Figure 1.7. Spherical bacteria, known as cocci, include common pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes. spherical bacteria, rod-shaped bacteria, spiral-shaped bacteria Figure 1.7 Prokaryotic Cell Shapes (a) Cocci (Staphylococcus aureus), (b) Bacilli (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), (c) Spirilli (Leptospira interrogans) Rod-shaped bacteria, like Escherichia coli, are known as bacilli.
*$%pass: Finally, spiral-shaped bacteria, known as spirilli, include such species as Treponema pallidum, which causes Very few pathogenic bacteria are spiral shaped. The three most common are: Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease Leptospira interrogans, the cause of Weil’s disease Aerobes and Anaerobes Some bacteria require oxygen for survival, while others do not. Bacteria that require oxygen for metabolism are termed obligate aerobes. Other bacteria that use fermentation, or some other form of cellular metabolism that does not require oxygen, are called anaerobes. There are different types of anaerobes. Anaerobes that cannot survive in an oxygen-containing environment are called obligate anaerobes; the presence of oxygen leads to the production of reactive oxygen-containing radicals in these species, which leads to cell death. Other bacteria can toggle between metabolic processes, using oxygen for aerobic metabolism if it is present, and switching to anaerobic metabolism if it is not. These bacteria are called facultative anaerobes. Finally, aerotolerant anaerobes are unable to use oxygen for metabolism, but are not harmed by its presence in the environment.Some bacteria require oxygen for survival, while others do not.

*$%pass: Finally, aerotolerant anaerobes are unable to use oxygen for metabolism, but are not harmed by its presence in the environment. Prokaryotic Cell Structure One of the main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that prokaryotes lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, as shown in Figure 1.8. Prokaryotes are also single-celled organisms, meaning that each cell must be able to perform all of the functions necessary for life on its own. However, prokaryotes may live in colonies with other cells and may signal these cells to share information about the environment. cell wall and cell membrane containing ribosomes, DNA in nucleoid region, and a flagellum Figure 1.8 Prokaryotic Cell Structure Because prokaryotes do not form multicellular organisms, each bacterium is responsible for protecting itself from the environment. The cell wall forms the outer barrier of the cell. The next layer is the cell membrane (plasma membrane), which is composed of phospholipids, similar to that of a eukaryote. Together, the cell wall and the cell membrane are known as the envelope. The cell wall both provides structure and controls the movement of solutes into and out of the bacterium. This allows the cell to maintain a concentration gradient relative to the environment. In bacteria, there are two main types of cell wall: gram positive and gram negative. The type of cell wall is determined by the Gram staining process: a crystal violet stain, followed by a counterstain with a substance called safranin. If the envelope absorbs the crystal violet stain, it will appear deep purple, and the cell is said to be gram positive. If the envelope does not absorb the crystal violet stain, but absorbs the safranin counterstain, then the cell will appear pink-red, and it is said to be gram negative.
*$%pass: The antibiotic penicillin targets the enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. If a gram-positive cell cannot cross-link its cell wall, it no longer serves as an effective barrier. The bacterium then becomes susceptible to osmotic damage and lyses. Most bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms to penicillin, although a few bacteria—including Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes strep throat and some skin infections, and Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis—are still very sensitive to Gram-positive cell walls consist of a thick layer of peptidoglycan, a polymeric substance made from amino acids and sugars. In addition to its structural and barrier functions, the cell wall may also aid a bacterial pathogen by providing protection from a host organism’s immune system. In addition to peptidoglycan, the gram-positive cell wall also contains lipoteichoic acid. It is not clear what role this acid serves for the bacterium, but the human immune system may be activated by exposure to these Gram-negative cell walls are very thin and also contain peptidoglycan, but in much smaller amounts. The peptidoglycan cell walls of these bacteria are adjacent to the cell membrane, and are separated from the membrane by the periplasmic space. In addition to the cell wall and cell membrane, gram-negative bacteria also have outer membranes containing phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharides are the part of gram-negative bacteria that triggers an immune response in human beings; the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharides is much stronger than the response to lipoteichoic acid. Bacteria contain a cell wall, the composition of which is different in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Specific components of the cell wall can trigger an Flagella are long, whip-like structures that can be used for propulsion; bacteria may have one, two, or many flagella, depending on the species.
*$%pass: Flagella can be used to move toward food or away from toxins or immune cells. This ability of a cell to detect chemical stimuli and move toward or away from them is called chemotaxis. The flagella are composed of a filament, a basal body, and a hook, as shown in Figure 1.9. The filament is a hollow, helical structure composed of flagellin. The basal body is a complex structure that anchors the flagellum to the cytoplasmic membrane and is also the motor of the flagellum, which rotates at rates up to 300 Hz. The hook connects the filament and the basal body so that, as the basal body rotates, it exerts torque on the filament, which thereby spins and propels the bacterium forward. The overall structure of flagella is similar in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but there are slight differences due to the different physical structure and chemical composition of the envelope in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Archaea also contain flagella, but the structure of their flagella is quite different from that of bacteria and is unlikely to be asked about on Test Day. flagellum: filament, hook, basal body Figure 1.9 Prokaryotic Flagellum Structure The hook connects the filament to the basal body (the complex structure of which is shown). As mentioned earlier, prokaryotes concentrate DNA in a region of the cell known as the nucleoid region, which does not contain a nuclear envelope. Prokaryotic DNA is carried on a single circular chromosome which can be found coiled around histone-like proteins in some bacteria. True histones are found in Archaea. In addition, DNA acquired from external sources may also be carried on smaller circular structures known as plasmids.
*$%pass: Plasmids carry DNA that is not necessary for survival of the prokaryote—and therefore is not considered part of the genome of the bacterium—but may confer an advantage such as antibiotic resistance. Prokaryotes lack several key organelles, such as mitochondria. Instead, the cell membrane is used for the electron transport chain and generation of ATP. Prokaryotes do contain a primitive cytoskeleton, but it is not nearly as complex as the one found in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes also contain ribosomes, but this ribosome is a different size from that found in eukaryotes: prokaryotic ribosomes contain 30S and 50S subunits, whereas eukaryotic ribosomes contain 40S and 60S subunits. The fact that prokaryotes and eukaryotes have different-sized ribosomes implies that they carry out protein synthesis in slightly different ways. These differences are highlighted in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. This difference also allows us to target bacterial ribosomes with a number of antibiotics, including tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and macrolides, while leaving the eukaryotic ribosome more or less MCAT Concept Check 1.3 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these questions. 1.

How do the structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic flagella differ? Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking To investigate the collective resistance property of bacteria, co- colonization experiments were CmS:chloramphenicol resistant (CmR) pneumococci (1:1).
*$%pass: One hour post-infection, mice were treated with one intraperitoneal injection of chloramphenicol (Cm) at a concentration of 75 mg kg1, followed by two additional doses spaced 5 hours apart. Control mice received vehicle injection only. CmR pneumococci are Cm resistant due to the expression of a resistance factor, chloramphenicol one bacteria to a mixture of two mice, then give (IP) injections of or vehicle only (vehicle is just Stable bacterial coexistence requires successful adjustment to several ecological constraints, such as limited resources and antibiotic concentration. To better quantify bacterial behavior under these conditions, in vitro population analysis was conducted.

The dot indicates Figure 1 experiment antibiotic levels, with previous analysis establishing CmS only (area S), CmR only (area R), no bacterial growth (area N), and competition-induced extinction (area E, where CmS bacteria first outcompete CmR bacteria and are subsequently cleared by antibiotic). density of CmR is at 200 min, levels off at Based on the Adapted from Sorg, R. A., Lin, L., Van Doorn, G. S., Sorg, M., Olson, J., Nizet, V., & Veening, J. W. (2016). Collective resistance in microbial communities by intracellular antibiotic deactivation. PLoS Biology, 14(12), e2000631. Consider the following: For successful co-colonization with CmS, the growth efficiency of CmR must remain as a constant value in the presence or absence of antibiotic stress. Is this conclusion valid?
*$%pass: This question asks us to analyze a conclusion’s validity. First, we must find where the key term is located in the passage. In this case, we are asked about growth efficiency, which can be found in the figure description of Figure 2b. According to the description, growth efficiency is a reference to the growth rate of CmR, and is depicted as the x-axis of the graph. The conclusion given in the question stem states that the growth efficiency is unchanged by the presence of antibiotics. To determine if this conclusion is valid, we first need to decipher what the graph represents. The figure description can be a rich source of crucial information. According to that same Figure 2b description, each area on the graph depicts a different outcome of CmS and CmR co-colonization. To ensure we’re drawing valid conclusions, we should examine the graph one axis at a time. To analyze a graph, hold one variable constant first. Assume no antibiotics are present, meaning that the antibiotic stress is zero, looking at the x-axis along the zero line, as the growth efficiency of CmR decreases, the CmS strain starts to outcompete it. In fact, unless the growth efficiency of CmR is at its highest, the susceptible strain (CmS) will always outcompete CmR. Now let’s hold the same variable at a different level. Let us assume the antibiotic stress is high, so we’ll look to the right side of the x-axis. Under those conditions, there’s no growth of the susceptible strain at all. That makes sense, as the susceptible strain wouldn’t be expected to survive the antibiotics. We can also see that, for this x-axis value, there’s an area, E, where at slightly lower CmR growth efficiency, the susceptible strain outcompetes CmR, removing all protection, and then succumbs to the antibiotic.
*$%pass: In fact, unless the growth efficiency of CmR is high, no bacteria will successfully grow. From these two observations, we can observe that the growth efficiency of the CmR strain has a large influence on how the co-colonized strain will grow. The shaded area of Figure 2b is not explained in the figure description, but we can deduce its meaning through context. All the other possibilities already have a designated area on the graph based on the figure label except for successful co-colonization. Also, the shaded area is between the area of CmS only and CmR only areas. From the figure description, we also learned that the large dot indicates the experiment conducted in Figure 1’s conditions, and Figure 1’s experiment demonstrates successful co- colonization. Thus, we can conclude that the shaded area is the region of successful co- colonization of the two strains. The conclusion presented in the question stem claims that growth efficiency of CmR does not change with or without the antibiotic presence. To assess this, we simply need to compare those two conditions. With no antibiotics, we can see that successful co- colonization only occurs when the growth efficiency of the CmR is at 1. If the growth efficiency is not that high, then the CmS strain will outcompete it. When we raise the antibiotic level to that of the red dot, we can see that if the growth efficiency remains at 1, the CmR bacteria will outcompete the CmS bacteria. In order for the two strains to coexist under antibiotic stress, the resistance strain’s growth efficiency has to be lower than 1. Thus, we can reasonably argue that the conclusion is not valid.
*$%pass: 1.4Genetics and Growth of Prokaryotic Cells High- After Chapter 1.4, you will be able to: Describe bacterial genetic recombination via transformation, conjugation, or Recall the four phases of a bacterial growth curve and the major features of each As we have seen, prokaryotic cells differ from eukaryotic cells both structurally and biochemically. Prokaryotes reproduce via asexual reproduction in the form of binary fission. In addition, prokaryotes are capable of acquiring and using genetic material from outside the cell. Binary fission, shown in Figure 1.10, is a simple form of asexual reproduction seen in prokaryotes. The circular chromosome attaches to the cell wall and replicates while the cell continues to grow in size. Eventually, the plasma membrane and cell wall begin to grow inward along the midline of the cell to produce two identical daughter cells. Because binary fission requires fewer events than mitosis, it can proceed more rapidly. In fact, some strains of E. coli can replicate every 20 minutes under ideal growth Figure 1.10 Stages of Binary Fission This single circular chromosome of a prokaryotic cell contains the information that is necessary for the cell to survive and reproduce. However, many bacteria also contain extrachromosomal (extragenomic) material known as plasmids. Plasmids often carry genes that impart some benefit to the bacterium, such as antibiotic resistance, some mechanisms of which are shown in Figure 1.11. Plasmids may also carry additional virulence factors, or traits that increase pathogenicity, such as toxin production, projections that allow attachment to certain kinds of cells, or features that allow evasion of the host’s immune system. A subset of plasmids called episomes are capable of integrating into the genome of the bacterium. Figure 1.11 Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance Bacterial genetic recombination helps increase bacterial diversity and thus permits evolution of a bacterial species over time.
*$%pass: These Transformation results from the integration of foreign genetic material into the host genome. This foreign genetic material most frequently comes from other bacteria that, upon lysing, spill their contents into the vicinity of a bacterium capable of transformation. Many gram-negative rods are able to carry out this process. Conjugation is the bacterial form of mating (sexual reproduction). It involves two cells forming a conjugation bridge between them that facilitates the transfer of genetic material. The transfer is unidirectional, from the donor male (+) to the recipient female (–). The bridge is made from appendages called sex pili that are found on the donor male. To form the pilus, bacteria must contain plasmids known as sex factors that contain the necessary genes. The best-studied sex factor is the F (fertility) factor in E. coli. Bacteria possessing this plasmid are termed F+ cells; those without are called F– cells. During conjugation the F+ cell replicates its F factor and donates the copy to the F– cell, converting it to an F+ cell. This enables the cell obtaining the new plasmid to then transfer copies to other cells. This method of genetic recombination allows for rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance or virulence factors throughout a colony because other plasmids can also be passed through the conjugation bridge. The process of conjugation is illustrated in Figure 1.12. Figure 1.12 Bacterial Conjugation The sex factor is a plasmid, but through processes such as transformation, it can become integrated into the host genome. In this case, when conjugation occurs, the entire genome replicates because it now contains the sex factor. The donor cell will then attempt to transfer an entire copy of its genome into the recipient; however, the bridge usually breaks before the full DNA sequence can be moved.
*$%pass: Cells that have undergone this change are referred to by the abbreviation Hfr for high frequency of Transduction is the only genetic recombination process that requires a vector—a virus that carries genetic material from one bacterium to another. Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens, which means that they cannot reproduce outside of a host cell. Because of this, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) can accidentally incorporate a segment of host DNA during assembly. When the bacteriophage infects another bacterium, it can release this trapped DNA into the new host cell. This transferred DNA can then integrate into the genome, giving the new host additional genes. The process of transduction is shown in Figure 1.13. Figure 1.13 Bacterial Transduction Transposons are genetic elements capable of inserting and removing themselves from the genome. This phenomenon is not limited to prokaryotes; it has been seen in eukaryotes as well. If a transposon is inserted within a coding region of a gene, that gene may be disrupted. As discussed previously, bacteria reproduce via binary fission. This implies that all of the bacteria are exactly the same in a local colony (assuming no mutations or genetic recombination), and that no bacteria are dividing faster than the others. Bacteria can be said to grow in a series of phases, as shown in Figure 1.14. In a new environment, bacteria first adapt to the new local conditions during the lag phase. As the bacteria adapt, the rate of division increases, causing an exponential increase in the number of bacteria in the colony during the exponential phase, also called the log phase. As the number of bacteria in the colony grows, resources are often reduced. The reduction of resources slows reproduction, and the stationary phase results.
*$%pass: After the bacteria have exceeded the ability of the environment to support the number of bacteria, a death phase occurs, marking the depletion of resources. Figure 1.14 Bacterial Growth Curve One of the biggest challenges a doctor faces is patient compliance with treatment, especially antibiotics. Many patients fail to complete an entire course of antibiotics, often discontinuing the treatment because they feel better. Unfortunately, this breeds antibiotic resistance by killing off the bacteria that are nonresistant and leaving behind bacteria that are more resistant. These resistant bacteria then reproduce, resulting in recurrence of the infection. Over time, this practice has led to bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, making common infections more difficult to treat. The bacterial growth curve is an example of a semilog plot. The fact that the y-axis is logarithmic means that a straight line (as seen during the exponential phase) actually represents an exponential increase in the number of bacteria, not a linear increase. Semilog and log–log plots are discussed in Chapter 12 of MCAT Physics and Math MCAT Concept Check 1.4 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these questions. 1. Briefly describe the three mechanisms of bacterial genetic recombination: 2. What are the four phases of the bacterial growth curve?
*$%pass: What are the features of 1.5Viruses and Subviral Particles After Chapter 1.5, you will be able to: Explain why viruses are defined as “obligate intracellular parasites” Recall key virus terminology, including retrovirus and positive/negative sense Describe how viruses are able to produce progeny via infection of a host cell Compare and contrast the lytic and lysogenic cycles Describe how prions and viroids are able to cause disease At the beginning of this chapter, we discussed the cell theory and noted that viruses do not fit the definition of living things because they are acellular. Viruses may be as small as 20 nm or as large as 300 nm. For reference, prokaryotes are 1–10 µm, and eukaryotes are about ten times larger. Unlike eukaryotic cells, viruses lack organelles and a nucleus. Viruses are composed of genetic material, a protein coat, and sometimes an envelope containing lipids. The genetic information may be circular or linear, single- or double- stranded, and composed of either DNA or RNA. The protein coat is known as a capsid, which may be surrounded by an envelope composed of phospholipids and virus-specific proteins. The envelope is very sensitive to heat, detergents, and desiccation; thus, enveloped viruses are easier to kill. On the other hand, viruses that do not have an envelope are more resistant to sterilization and are likely to persist on surfaces for an extended period of time. Because viruses cannot reproduce independently, they are considered obligate intracellular parasites. Viruses must express and replicate genetic information within a host cell because they lack ribosomes to carry out protein synthesis. After hijacking a cell’s machinery, a virus will replicate and produce viral progeny, called virions, which can be released to infect additional cells. Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically target bacteria.
*$%pass: They do not actually enter bacteria; rather, they simply inject their genetic material, leaving the remaining structures outside the infected cell. In addition to a capsid, bacteriophages contain a tail sheath and tail fibers, as shown in Figure 1.15. The tail sheath can act like a syringe, injecting genetic material into a bacterium. The tail fibers help the bacteriophage recognize and connect to the correct host cell. Figure 1.15 Structure of a Bacteriophage Viral genomes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are made of only a few genes, while others have several hundred. In addition, viral genomes may be made of either single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA. Single-stranded RNA viruses may be positive sense or negative sense. Positive sense implies that the genome may be directly translated to functional proteins by the ribosomes of the host cell, just like mRNA. Negative-sense RNA viruses are a bit more complicated: the negative-sense RNA strand acts as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand, which can then be used as a template for protein synthesis. Negative-sense RNA viruses must carry an RNA replicase in the virion to ensure that the complementary strand is synthesized. Retroviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Retroviridae; usually, the virion contains two identical RNA molecules. These viruses carry an enzyme known as reverse transcriptase, which synthesizes DNA from single-stranded RNA. The DNA then integrates into the host cell genome, where it is replicated and transcribed as if it were the host cell’s own DNA. This is a clever mechanism because the integration of the genetic material into the host cell genome allows the cell to be infected indefinitely, so the only way to remove the infection is to kill the infected cell.
*$%pass: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that utilizes this life cycle, which is one of the characteristics that make HIV so difficult to treat, as shown in Figure Figure 1.16 Life Cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Both retroviruses and transduction are under investigation as methods of gene therapy. It is theorized that retroviral and transduction methods can deliver functional versions of missing or altered genes, so that the correct proteins can be synthesized and certain diseases can be treated. Gene therapy is discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Biochemistry Viral Life Cycle As we have already discussed, viruses must infect a host cell and use the host cell’s machinery in order to reproduce. Here, we will discuss the viral life cycle in detail. Viruses can only infect a specific set of cells, because they must bind to specific receptors on the host cell. Without the proper receptors, a cell is essentially invisible to the virus. Once the virus binds the correct receptor, the virus and the cell are brought into close enough proximity to permit additional interactions. Enveloped viruses fuse with the plasma membrane of a cell, allowing entry of the virion into the host cell. Sometimes a host cell may mistake a virus bound to the membrane as nutrients or other useful molecules and will actually bring the virus into the cytoplasm via endocytosis. As mentioned earlier, bacteriophages use tail fibers to anchor themselves to the cell membrane and then inject their genome into the host bacterium through the tail sheath. Some tail fibers even have enzymatic activity, allowing for both penetration of the cell wall and the formation of pores in the cell membrane. Depending on the virus, different portions of the virion will be inserted into host cells.
*$%pass: Enveloped viruses such as HIV fuse with the membrane and enter the cell intact, whereas bacteriophages only insert their genetic material, leaving their capsids outside the host cell. HIV must bind to a receptor called CCR5 on white blood cells in order to infect them. Some people lack this receptor and are thus immune to HIV. There was recently a case in which an HIV-positive individual with leukemia received a bone marrow transplant from a donor that lacked CCR5. Not only was the leukemia cured, but the patient experienced remission of the HIV infection because the white blood cells from the newly acquired bone marrow were not susceptible to HIV infection. Translation and Progeny Assembly After infection, translation of viral genetic material must occur in order for the virus to reproduce. This requires translocation of the genetic material to the correct location in the cell. Most DNA viruses must enter the nucleus in order to be transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA then goes to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into proteins. Genetic material from positive-sense RNA viruses stays in the cytoplasm, where it is directly translated into protein by host cell ribosomes. Negative-sense RNA viruses require synthesis of a complementary RNA strand via RNA replicase, which can then be translated to form proteins. DNA formed through reverse transcription in retroviruses also travels to the nucleus, where it can be integrated into the host genome. Using the ribosomes, tRNA, amino acids, and enzymes of the host cell, viral RNA is translated into protein. Many of these proteins are structural capsid proteins and allow for the creation of new virions in the cytoplasm in the host cell. Once the viral genome has been replicated, it can be packaged within the capsid.
*$%pass: Note that the viral genome must be returned to its original form before packaging; for example, retroviruses must transcribe new copies of their single-stranded RNA from the DNA that entered the host genome. A single virus may create anywhere from hundreds to many thousands of new virions within a single host cell. Viral progeny may be released in multiple ways. First, the viral invasion may initiate cell death, which results in spilling of the viral progeny. Second, the host cell may lyse as a result of being filled with extremely large numbers of virions. Lysis is actually a disadvantage for the virus because the virus can no longer use the cell to carry out its life cycle. Finally, a virus can leave the cell by fusing with its plasma membrane as shown in Figure 1.17, a process known as extrusion. This process keeps the host cell alive, and thus allows for the continued use of the host cell by the virus. A virus in this state is said to be in a productive cycle. Figure 1.17 Viral Extrusion Lytic and Lysogenic Cycles Depending on growth conditions and the specific virus, bacteriophages may enter a lytic or lysogenic life cycle. These two phases are similar to the lysis and productive cycle methods of progeny release discussed above. During a lytic cycle, the bacteriophage maximizes the use of the cell’s machinery with little regard for the survival of the host cell. Once the host is swollen with new virions, the cell lyses, and other bacteria can be infected. Viruses in the lytic phase are termed In the event that the virus does not lyse the bacterium, it may integrate into the host genome as a provirus or prophage, initiating the lysogenic cycle.
*$%pass: In this case, the virus will be replicated as the bacterium reproduces because it is now a part of the host’s genome. Although the virus may remain integrated into the host genome indefinitely, environmental factors (radiation, light, or chemicals) may cause the provirus to leave the genome and revert to a lytic cycle. As mentioned earlier, the provirus may extract bacterial genes as it leaves the genome, which allows transduction of genes from one bacterium to another. Although bacteriophages can kill their hosts, integration of the phage into the host genome may actually benefit the bacterium. Infection with one strain of phage generally makes the bacterium less susceptible to superinfection (simultaneous infection) with other phages. Because the provirus is relatively innocuous, this arrangement may confer an evolutionary advantage. The lytic and lysogenic cycles are contrasted in Figure 1.18. Figure 1.18 Lytic vs. Lysogenic Cycles of Bacteriophages Prions and Viroids Prions and viroids are very small (subviral) particles that can cause disease under certain Prions are infectious proteins and are, therefore, nonliving things. They cause disease by triggering misfolding of other proteins, usually through the conversion of a protein from an α-helical structure to a β-pleated sheet. This drastically reduces the solubility of the protein, as well as the ability of the cell to degrade the protein. Eventually, protein aggregates form, interfering with cell function. Prions are known to cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and familial fatal insomnia in humans. Viroids are small pathogens consisting of a very short circular single-stranded RNA that infect plants. Viroids can bind to a large number of RNA sequences and can silence genes in the plant genome. This prevents synthesis of necessary proteins, resulting in metabolic disruption and structural damage to the cell.
*$%pass: Viroids are classically thought of as plant pathogens, but a few examples of human viroids do exist, including the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Alone, HDV is innocuous; however, when coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), HDV is able to exert its silencing effect on human hepatocytes. MCAT Concept Check 1.5 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these questions. 1. Why are viruses considered obligate intracellular parasites? 2. A coronavirus, which causes the common cold, is described as an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. What does this indicate about the virus? 3. Briefly describe the pathway of retroviral nucleic acids from infection of a host cell to release of viral progeny: 4. What are the differences between the lytic and lysogenic cycles? 5. How do prions cause disease? Our first chapter introduced the basis of all biology: cell theory. All living things are made of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are simpler and do not contain membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotes contain membrane-bound organelles with highly specialized functions. While eukaryotic organisms (especially humans!) will be the primary focus on Test Day, an understanding of prokaryotic structure and physiology is necessary to understand infectious disease. Viruses are nonliving infectious particles that must invade cells in order to reproduce. Finally, we discussed the smallest infectious particles, prions and viroids. Our discussions from here on out will focus primarily on eukaryotes, but you will spend significant time in your clinical career battling the pathogens we’ve presented in this chapter.
*$%pass: Vaccines are available for a number of bacteria (Bacillus anthracis [anthrax], Corynebacterium diphtheriae [diphtheria], Haemophilus influenzae type B [many upper respiratory and ear infections], Neisseria meningitidis [some cases of bacterial meningitis], Streptoccocus pneumoniae [many cases of bacterial pneumonia], Clostridium tetani [tetanus], Salmonella typhi [typhoid], and Bordetella pertussis [whooping cough]) and viruses (varicella-zoster virus [chickenpox and shingles], hepatitis A and B viruses, human papillomavirus [HPV], influenza, measles, mumps, polio, rabies, rotavirus, rubella, and yellow fever). Those for which we do not have vaccines may be targeted with antibiotic and antiviral therapies; the appropriate pharmacotherapy usually depends on an understanding of bacterial or viral physiology and the known resistance patterns in the local area. In other words, the principles presented in this chapter will show up in your everyday life as a physician! We’ve discussed one method of cellular reproduction: the division of a bacterial cell into two cells by binary fission. Eukaryotic cells also must replicate, but use a different process: mitosis. In the next chapter, we will turn our attention to mitosis, as well as meiosis and human reproduction. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online The cell theory has four basic tenets: All living things are composed of cells. The cell is the basic functional unit of life. Cells arise only from preexisting cells. Cells carry genetic information in the form of DNA. This genetic material is passed on from parent to daughter cell.
*$%pass: Viruses are not considered living things because they are acellular, cannot reproduce without the assistance of a host cell, and may use RNA as their genetic Eukaryotes have membrane-bound organelles, a nucleus, and may form The cell membrane and membranes of organelles contain phospholipids, which organize to form hydrophilic interior and exterior surfaces with a hydrophobic core. The cytosol suspends the organelles and allows diffusion of molecules throughout The eukaryotic organelles each serve specific functions: The nucleus contains DNA organized into chromosomes. It is surrounded by the nuclear membrane or envelope, a double membrane that contains nuclear pores for two-way exchange of materials between the nucleus and cytosol. DNA is organized into coding regions called genes. The nucleolus is a subsection of the nucleus in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) Mitochondria contain an outer and inner membrane. The outer membrane forms a barrier with the cytosol; the inner membrane is folded into cristae and contains enzymes for the electron transport chain. Between the membranes is the intermembrane space; inside the inner mitochondrial membrane is the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria can divide independently of the nucleus via binary fission and can trigger apoptosis by releasing mitochondrial enzymes into the cytoplasm. Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down substances ingested by endocytosis and cellular waste products. When these enzymes are released, autolysis of the cell can occur. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a series of interconnected membranes and is continuous with the nuclear envelope. The rough ER (RER) is studded with ribosomes, which permit translation of proteins destined for secretion. The smooth ER (SER) is used for lipid synthesis and detoxification.
*$%pass: The Golgi apparatus consists of stacked membrane-bound sacs in which cellular products can be modified, packaged, and directed to specific cellular Peroxisomes contain hydrogen peroxide and can break down very long chain fatty acids via β-oxidation. They also participate in phospholipid synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The cytoskeleton provides stability and rigidity to the overall structure of the cell, while also providing transport pathways for molecules within the cell. Microfilaments are composed of actin. They provide structural protection for the cell and can cause muscle contraction through interactions with myosin. They also help form the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in mitosis. Microtubules are composed of tubulin. They create pathways for motor proteins like kinesin and dynein to carry vesicles. They also contribute to the structure of cilia and flagella, where they are organized into nine pairs of microtubules in a ring with two microtubules at the center (9 + 2 structure). Centrioles are found in centrosomes and are involved in microtubule organization in the mitotic spindle. Intermediate filaments are involved in cell–cell adhesion and maintenance of the integrity of the cytoskeleton; they help anchor organelles. Common examples include keratin and desmin. Epithelial tissues cover the body and line its cavities, protecting against pathogen invasion and desiccation. Some epithelial cells absorb or secrete substances, or participate in sensation. In most organs, epithelial cells form the parenchyma, or the functional parts of the organ. Epithelial cells may be polarized, with one side facing a lumen or the outside world, and the other side facing blood vessels and structural cells. Epithelia can be classified by the number of layers: simple epithelia have one layer, stratified epithelia have many layers, and pseudostratified epithelia appear to have multiple layers due to differences in cell heights, but actually have only one layer.
*$%pass: Epithelia can be classified by the shapes of the cells: cuboidal cells are cube- shaped, columnar cells are long and narrow, and squamous cells are flat and Connective tissues support the body and provide a framework for epithelial cells. In most organs, connective tissues form the stroma or support structure by secreting materials to form an extracellular matrix. Bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood are all Classification and Structure of Prokaryotic Cells Prokaryotes do not contain membrane-bound organelles; they contain their genetic material in a single circular molecule of DNA located in the nucleoid region. There are three overarching domains of life; prokaryotes account for two of these: Archaea are often extremophiles, living in harsh environments (high temperature, high salinity, no light) and often use chemical sources of energy (chemosynthesis) rather than light (photosynthesis). They have similarities to both eukaryotes (start translation with methionine, similar RNA polymerases, histones) and bacteria (single circular chromosome, divide by binary fission or Bacteria have many similar structures to eukaryotes, and have complex relationships with humans, including mutualistic symbiosis and Eukarya is the only non-prokaryotic domain. Bacteria can be classified by shape: Spherical bacteria are called cocci. Rod-shaped bacteria are called bacilli. Spiral-shaped bacteria are called spirilli. Bacteria can be classified based on metabolic processes: Obligate aerobes require oxygen for metabolism. Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in oxygen-containing environments and can only carry out anaerobic metabolism. Facultative anaerobes can survive in environments with or without oxygen and will toggle between metabolic processes based on the environment. Aerotolerant anaerobes cannot use oxygen for metabolism, but can survive in an oxygen-containing environment. The cell wall and cell membrane of bacteria form the envelope. Together, they control the movement of solutes into and out of the cell.
*$%pass: Bacteria can be classified by the color their cell walls turn during Gram staining with a crystal violet stain, followed by a counterstain with safranin. Gram-positive bacteria turn purple, while gram-negative bacteria turn pink- Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall composed of peptidoglycan and Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall composed of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane containing phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides. Bacteria may have one, two, or many flagella that generate propulsion to move the bacterium toward food or away from immune cells. Moving in response to chemical stimuli is called chemotaxis. Bacterial flagella contain a filament composed of flagellin, a basal body that anchors and rotates the flagellum, and a hook that connects the two. Prokaryotes carry out the electron transport chain using the cell membrane. Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes (30S and 50S, rather than 40S and 60S). Genetics and Growth of Prokaryotic Cells Prokaryotes multiply through binary fission, in which the chromosome replicates while the cell grows in size, until the cell wall begins to grow inward along the midline of the cell and divides it into two identical daughter cells. In addition to the single circular chromosome in prokaryotes, extrachromosomal material can be carried in plasmids. Plasmids may contain antibiotic resistance genes or virulence factors. Plasmids that can integrate into the genome are called Bacterial genetic recombination increases bacterial diversity. Transformation occurs when genetic material from the surroundings is taken up by a cell, which can incorporate this material into its genome.
*$%pass: Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another across a conjugation bridge; a plasmid can be transferred from F+ cells to F– cells, or a portion of the genome can be transferred from an Hfr cell to a Transduction is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another via a bacteriophage vector. Transposons are genetic elements that can insert into or remove themselves from the genome. Bacterial growth follows a predictable pattern: The bacteria adapt to new local conditions during the lag phase. Growth then increases exponentially during the exponential (log) phase. As resources are reduced, growth levels off during the stationary phase. As resources are depleted, bacteria undergo a death phase. Viruses and Subviral Particles Viruses contain genetic material, a protein coat (capsid), and sometimes a lipid- Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning that they cannot survive and replicate outside of a host cell. Individual virus particles are called virions. Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria. In addition to the other structures, they contain a tail sheath, which injects the genetic material into a bacterium, and tail fibers, which allow the bacteriophage to attach to the host cell. Viral genomes may be made of various nucleic acids: They may be composed of DNA or RNA and may be single- or double- Single-stranded RNA viruses may be positive sense (that can be translated by the host cell) or negative sense (which requires a complementary strand to be synthesized by RNA replicase before translation). Retroviruses contain a single-stranded RNA genome, from which a complementary DNA strand is made using reverse transcriptase. The DNA strand can then be integrated into the genome.
*$%pass: Viruses infect cells by attaching to specific receptors, and can then enter the cell by fusing with the plasma membrane, being brought in by endocytosis, or injecting their genome into the cell. The virus reproduces by replicating and translating genetic material using the host cell’s ribosomes, tRNA, amino acids, and enzymes. Viral progeny are released through cell death, lysis, or extrusion. Bacteriophages have two specific life cycles: In the lytic cycle, the bacteriophage produces massive numbers of new virions until the cell lyses. Bacteria in the lytic phase are termed virulent. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus integrates into the host genome as a provirus or prophage, which can then reproduce along with the cell. The provirus can remain in the genome indefinitely, or may leave the genome in response to a stimulus and enter the lytic cycle. Prions are infectious proteins that trigger misfolding of other proteins, usually converting an α-helical structure to a β-pleated sheet. This decreases the solubility of the protein and increases its resistance to degradation. Viroids are plant pathogens that are small circles of complementary RNA that can turn off genes, resulting in metabolic and structural changes and, potentially, cell Answers to Concept Checks 1. All living things are made of cells. The cell is the basic functional unit of life. All cells arise from other cells. Genetic information is carried in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and is passed from parent to daughter cell. 1. The nucleus stores genetic information and is the site of transcription. The mitochondria are involved in ATP production and apoptosis. Lysosomes break down cellular waste products and molecules ingested through endocytosis, and can also be involved in apoptosis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes proteins destined for secretion. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification.
*$%pass: The Golgi apparatus packages, modifies, and distributes cellular products. Peroxisomes break down very long chain fatty acids, synthesize lipids, and contribute to the pentose phosphate pathway. 2. Peroxisomes are dependent on hydrogen peroxide for their functions, so an enzyme deficiency that results in an inability to form hydrogen peroxide would likely result in an inability to digest very long chain fatty acids. These fatty acids would build up in peroxisomes until they displaced cellular contents, ultimately resulting in cell 3. Microfilaments are composed of actin. Microtubules are composed of tubulin. Intermediate filaments differ by cell type, but may be composed of keratin, desmin, vimentin, and lamins. 4. Centrioles consist of nine triplets of microtubules around a hollow center, while flagella consist of nine doublets on the outside, with two microtubules on the 5. Endothelial cells and α-cells are epithelial cells. Fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts are connective tissue cells. 1. Archaea are similar to bacteria in that both are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, contain a single circular chromosome, and divide by binary fission or budding. They are similar to eukaryotes in that they start translation with methionine, contain similar RNA polymerases, and contain DNA associated with histones. 2. The three common shapes of bacteria are spherical (cocci), rod-shaped (bacilli), and spiral-shaped (spirilli). Can carry out aerobic Can carry out 4. The antibiotic penicillin targets the enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid, and contain no outer membrane, whereas gram-negative bacteria have only a thin layer of peptidoglycan but also have an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids. Penicillin and antibiotics with similar function can more easily reach and weaken the peptidoglycan layer of 5.
*$%pass: Eukaryotic flagella contain microtubules composed of tubulin, organized in a 9 + 2 arrangement. Bacterial flagella are made of flagellin and consist of a filament, a basal body, and a hook. 1. Transformation is the acquisition of exogenous genetic material that can be integrated into the bacterial genome. Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another across a conjugation bridge; a plasmid can be transferred from F+ cells to F cells, or a portion of the genome can be transferred from an Hfr cell to a recipient. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage. Bacteria get used to environment; little growth Bacteria use available resources to multiply at an exponential Stationary phase Bacterial multiplication slows as resources are used up Bacteria die as resources become insufficient to support the 1. Viruses do not contain organelles such as ribosomes; therefore, in order to reproduce and synthesize proteins, viruses must infect cells and hijack their 2. This description indicates that the virus contains an outer layer of phospholipids with an inner capsid. Within the capsid, there is single-stranded RNA that can be immediately translated to protein by the ribosomes of the host cell. 3. The nucleic acid enters as single-stranded RNA, which undergoes reverse transcription (using reverse transcriptase) to form double-stranded DNA. This DNA enters the host genome and replicates with the host cell. The DNA is transcribed to mRNA, which can be used to make structural proteins. This mRNA doubles as the viral genome for new virions. Once new virions are assembled from the structural proteins and mRNA (single-stranded RNA) genome, the virions can be released to infect other cells. 4.
*$%pass: In the lytic cycle, bacteriophages replicate in the host cell in extremely high numbers until the host cell lyses and releases the virions. In the lysogenic cycle, the bacteriophage genome enters the host genome and replicates with the host cell as a provirus. In response to an appropriate stimulus, the provirus may leave the host genome and can be used to synthesize new virions. 5. Prions cause disease by triggering a change in the conformation of a protein from an α-helix to a β-pleated sheet. This change reduces solubility of the protein and makes it highly resistant to degradation. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Obligate anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen and would likely be killed by such a therapy, treating the infection. The other types of bacteria listed can all survive in the presence of oxygen, so infections involving these bacteria would likely not be treated using this therapy. While bones and tendons are composed predominantly of connective tissue cells, muscle tissue is considered a different tissue type. Other examples of connective tissue include cartilage, ligaments, adipose tissue, and blood. Connective tissue often secretes substances to form the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and elastin, eliminating (B). (C) and (D) are essentially identical and can both be eliminated: in organs, connective tissue often forms the support structure for epithelial cells, called the stroma. In a virus, the nucleic acid can be either DNA or RNA and—in both cases—can be either single- or double-stranded. Therefore, all of the types of nucleic acids listed here could be used for a viral genome, making (D) the correct answer. The process of sterilization kills all living cells. A lack of cellular growth in these conditions supports the idea that cells can only arise from preexisting cells, matching (C).
*$%pass: By contrast, since this experiment did not directly visualize the cells, nor did it analyze the genetic material, (A), (B), and (D) can be eliminated. Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from an anaerobic prokaryote engulfing an aerobic prokaryote and establishing a symbiotic relationship; therefore, mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA, is likely to be similar to bacterial DNA. Both mDNA and bacterial DNA are organized into a single circular chromosome of double-stranded DNA that can replicate during binary fission. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, while Statement III is incorrect. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the transport of materials throughout the cell, in lipid synthesis, and in the detoxification of drugs and poisons. Proteins from the rough ER can cross into the smooth ER, where they are secreted into cytoplasmic vesicles and transported to the Golgi apparatus. However, protein synthesis is not a function of the smooth ER, but rather of the free ribosomes or the ribosomes associated with the rough ER. (C) is therefore the The nucleolus (not to be confused with the nucleus) is a dense structure within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized. (A) is therefore the correct Lysosomes are vesicular organelles that digest material using hydrolytic enzymes. They are surrounded by a single membrane. Both mitochondria and nuclei are surrounded by double membranes, eliminating (B) and (C). Ribosomes must not be surrounded by membranes because they are found not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes, which lack any membrane-bound organelles. This eliminates (D).
*$%pass: Some of the main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, while eukaryotes do, eliminating (B); prokaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 30S and 50S, while eukaryotes have ribosomal subunits of 40S and 60S, eliminating (A); and prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotes do, eliminating (D). The presence of a membrane on the outer surface of the cell could not distinguish a prokaryotic cell from a eukaryotic one because both gram-negative bacteria and animal cells share this feature. Thus, (C) is the correct answer. Tubulin is the primary protein in microtubules, which are responsible for the structure and movement of cilia and flagella, eliminating (A) and (B). Centrioles organize microtubules into the mitotic spindle, eliminating (D). Microfilaments are not composed of tubulin, but rather actin, making (C) the correct answer. Viruses can exist in either the lytic or lysogenic cycle; they may even switch between them. During the lytic cycle, the virus’s DNA takes control of the host cell’s genetic machinery, manufacturing numerous progeny. In the end, the host cell bursts (lyses) and releases new virions, each capable of infecting other cells. In the lysogenic cycle, viral DNA is added to the host cell’s genome, where it can remain dormant for days or years. Either spontaneously or as a result of environmental circumstances, the provirus can reactivate and enter a lytic cycle. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect because the terms are reversed. (D) describes features of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria—not the human nervous system. (C) accurately describes how HSV operates during the lysogenic cycle, making it the correct answer. Bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, an asexual process in which the progeny is identical to the parent. Therefore, binary fission (Statement I) does not increase genetic variability.
*$%pass: Conjugation can be described as sexual mating in bacteria; it is the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria that are temporarily joined. Transduction occurs when fragments of the bacterial chromosome accidentally become packaged into viral progeny produced during a viral infection and are introduced into another bacterium by the viral vector. Therefore, both conjugation and transduction (Statements II and III) increase bacterial genetic variability. A bacterial cell that does not rapidly cause a phenotypic change in the rest of the colony is likely not F+, meaning that this cell is not able to form a sex pilus for conjugation, making (A) correct. The expression of new phenotypic characteristics indicates that this bacterium may have acquired genetic material from the environment through transformation, (B), or transduction (which occurs via bacteriophage infection), (C) and (D). Prions are infectious proteins that cause misfolding of other proteins. Prions generally cause a shift toward β-pleated sheet conformations, causing decreased solubility and increased resistance to degradation. This ultimately leads to disease. This mechanism is very similar to the one described here for Alzheimer’s disease, making (C) the correct answer. A virus that requires transport to the nucleus in order to produce viral proteins likely requires use of nuclear RNA polymerase in order to create mRNA that can be translated to protein. Therefore, only DNA viruses need to be transported to the nucleus to produce viral proteins, eliminating all answer choices but (A). Consult your online resources for additional practice.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content categories: 1C: Transmission of heritable information from generation to generation and the processes that increase genetic diversity 2C: Processes of cell division, differentiation, and specialization 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems All mammals share certain characteristics: milk-producing mammary glands, three bones in the middle ear and one in the lower jaw, fur or hair, heterodont dentition (different kinds of teeth), and both sebaceous (oil-producing) and sudoriferous (sweat) glands. What about placenta formation during embryonic development?
*$%pass: This is a characteristic of humans, as we’ll explore in Chapter 3 of MCAT Biology Review, but there are two groups of mammals that birth their young a bit differently: either break as proto- and therians, or keep together on the same line and metatherians. Prototherians (monotremes), which include the duckbilled platypus and echidna (spiny anteater), encase their developing embryos within hard-shelled amniotic eggs and lay them to be hatched, like reptiles. This method of development is referred to as oviparity. Metatherians (marsupials) include koalas and kangaroos. A typical metatherian fetus (joey) undergoes some development in its mother’s uterus and then climbs out of the birth canal and into her marsupium, or pouch. It might seem a bit strange that something as essential as reproduction can be so different between mammalian species, but there are, in fact, a wide variety of reproductive schemes in nature. Many organisms reproduce without a sexual partner. Others can reproduce sexually or asexually depending on environmental conditions. In Chapter 1 of MCAT Biology Review, we explored how bacteria and viruses reproduce. In this chapter, we’ll explore eukaryotic and female 2.1The Cell Cycle and Mitosis High-Yield After Chapter 2.1, you will be able to: Describe the four phases of mitosis and the major events during each phase Identify the five stages of the cell cycle and the major events during each In animals, autosomal cells are said to be diploid (2n), which means that they contain two copies of each chromosome. Germ cells, on the other hand, are haploid (n), containing only one copy of each chromosome. In humans, these numbers are 46 and 23, respectively; we inherit 23 chromosomes from each parent. Eukaryotic cells replicate through the cell cycle, a specific series of phases during which a cell grows, synthesizes DNA, and divides.
*$%pass: Derangements of the cell cycle can lead to unchecked cell division and may be responsible for the formation of cancer. The Cell Cycle The cell cycle, shown in Figure 2.1, is a perennial MCAT favorite. For actively dividing cells, the cell cycle consists of four stages: G1, S, G2, and M. The first three stages (G1, S, and G2) are known collectively as interphase. Interphase is the longest part of the cell cycle; even actively dividing cells spend about 90 percent of their time in interphase. Cells that do not divide spend all of their time in an offshoot of G1 called G0. During the G0 stage, the cell is simply living and carrying out its functions, without any preparation for division. Pie chart with G1, S, G2, M. G0 shown as an offshoot of G1. I shown as consisting of G1, S, and G2 combined. Figure 2.1 The Cell Cycle During interphase, individual chromosomes are not visible with light microscopy because they are in a less condensed form known as chromatin. This is because the DNA must be available to RNA polymerase so that genes can be transcribed. During mitosis, however, it is preferable to condense the DNA into tightly coiled chromosomes to avoid losing any genetic material during cell division. G1 Stage: Presynthetic Gap During the G1 stage, cells create organelles for energy and protein production (mitochondria, ribosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum), while also increasing their size. In addition, passage into the S (synthesis) stage is governed by a restriction point.
*$%pass: Certain criteria, such as containing the proper complement of DNA, must be met for the cell to pass the restriction point and enter the synthesis S Stage: Synthesis of DNA During the S stage, the cell replicates its genetic material so that each daughter cell will have identical copies. After replication, each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids that are bound together at a specialized region known as the centromere, as shown in Figure 2.2. Note that the ploidy of the cell does not change even though the number of chromatids has doubled. In other words, humans in this stage still only have 46 chromosomes, even though 92 chromatids are present. Cells entering G2 have twice as much DNA as cells in G1. one chromatid replicating to form two sister chromatids, held together at centromere Figure 2.2 Chromosome Replication A single chromatid replicates to form two sister chromatids. Each chromatid is composed of a complete double-stranded molecule of DNA. Sister chromatids are identical copies of each other. The term chromosome may be used to refer to either a single chromatid before S phase or the pair of chromatids attached at the centromere after S phase. G2 Stage: Postsynthetic Gap During the G2 stage, the cell passes through another quality control checkpoint. DNA has already been duplicated, and the cell checks to ensure that there are enough organelles and cytoplasm for two daughter cells. Furthermore, the cell checks to make sure that DNA replication proceeded correctly to avoid passing on an error to daughter cells that may further pass on the error to their progeny. M Stage: Mitosis The M stage consists of mitosis itself along with cytokinesis. Mitosis is divided into four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The features of each phase will be discussed in the next section.
*$%pass: Cytokinesis is the splitting of the cytoplasm and organelles between the two daughter cells. In autosomal cells, division results in two genetically identical daughter cells. In germ cells, the daughter cells are not equivalent. Control of the Cell Cycle The cell cycle is controlled by checkpoints, most notably between the G1 and S phase and the G2 and M phase. At the G1/S checkpoint, the cell determines if the condition of the DNA is good enough for synthesis. As mentioned previously, this checkpoint is also known as the restriction point. If there has been damage to the DNA, the cell cycle goes into arrest until the DNA has been repaired. The main protein in control of this is p53. At the G2/M checkpoint, the cell is mainly concerned with ensuring that it has achieved adequate size and the organelles have been properly replicated to support two daughter cells. p53 also plays a role in the G2/M checkpoint. The molecules responsible for the cell cycle are known as cyclins and cyclindependent kinases (CDK). In order to be activated, CDKs require the presence of the right cyclins. During the cell cycle, concentrations of the various cyclins increase and decrease during specific stages. These cyclins bind to CDKs, creating an activated CDK–cyclin complex. This complex can then phosphorylate transcription factors. Transcription factors then promote transcription of genes required for the next stage of the cell cycle. Cell cycle control is essential to ensure that cells that are damaged or inadequately sized do not divide. When cell cycle control becomes deranged, and damaged cells are allowed to undergo mitosis, cancer may result. One of the most common mutations found in cancer is mutation of the gene that produces p53, called TP53.
*$%pass: When this gene is mutated, the cell cycle is not stopped to repair damaged DNA. This allows mutations to accumulate, eventually resulting in a cancerous cell that divides continuously and without regard to the quality or quantity of the new cells produced. Often, cancer cells undergo rapid cell division, creating tumors. Eventually, if the cell begins to produce the right factors (such as proteases that can digest basement membranes or factors that encourage blood vessel formation), the damaged cells are then able to reach other tissues. This may include both local invasion as well as distant spread of cancerous cells through the bloodstream or lymphatic systems. The latter result is known as metastasis. Cancer-causing genes can often be classified into oncogenes (genes that, when mutated, actively promote cell division) and tumor suppressor genes (genes that, when mutated, lose their ability to regulate or arrest the cell cycle). Different cancer types are often associated with specific mutations in either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, or both. The biochemistry of these genes is discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. Mitosis, shown in Figure 2.3, is the process by which two identical daughter cells are created from a single cell. Mitosis consists of four distinct phases—prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—and occurs in somatic cells, or cells that are not involved in sexual reproduction. diagram of mitosis, as described subsequently in this chapter Figure 2.3 Mitosis Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells. Prophase is the first phase in mitosis. The first step in prophase involves condensation of the chromatin into chromosomes. Also, the centriole pairs separate and move toward opposite poles of the cell.
*$%pass: These paired cylindrical organelles, shown in Figure 2.4, are located outside the nucleus in a region known as the centrosome and are responsible for the correct division of DNA. Once the centrioles migrate to opposite poles of the cell, they begin to form spindle fibers, which are made of microtubules. This establishes the centrosome as one of the two microtubule organizing centers of the cell—the other being the basal body of a flagellum or cilium. Each of the fibers radiates outward from the centrioles. Some microtubules form asters that anchor the centrioles to the cell membrane. Others extend toward the middle of the cell. The nuclear membrane dissolves during prophase, allowing these spindle fibers to contact the chromosomes. The nucleoli become less distinct and may disappear completely. Kinetochores, which appear at the centrosome, are protein structures located on the centromeres that serve as attachment points for specific fibers of the spindle apparatus (appropriately called kinetochore fibers). centrosome with centrioles, composed of triplet microtubules Figure 2.4 The Centrosome Each centrosome contains two tubulin- based centrioles responsible for proper movement of the chromosomes The phases of mitosis: Prophase—chromosomes condense, spindle forms Anaphase—sister chromatids separate Telophase—new nuclear membranes form In metaphase, the centriole pairs are now at opposite ends of the cell. The kinetochore fibers interact with the fibers of the spindle apparatus to align the chromosomes at the metaphase plate (equatorial plate), which is equidistant from the two poles of the cell. During anaphase, the centromeres split so that each chromatid has its own distinct centromere, thus allowing the sister chromatids to separate. The sister chromatids are pulled toward the opposite poles of the cell by the shortening of the kinetochore fibers. Telophase and Cytokinesis Telophase is essentially the reverse of prophase. The spindle apparatus disappears.
*$%pass: A nuclear membrane reforms around each set of chromosomes, and the nucleoli reappear. The chromosomes uncoil, resuming their interphase form. Each of the two new nuclei receives a complete copy of the genome identical to the original genome and to each other. Cytokinesis, which occurs at the end of telophase, is the separation of the cytoplasm and organelles, giving each daughter cell enough material to survive on its own. Each cell undergoes a finite number of divisions before programmed death; for human somatic cells, this is usually between 20 and 50. After that, the cell can no longer divide continuously. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking The p53 tumor suppressor pathway has been heavily explored as a potential treatment for patients who have cancer. The p53 pathway induces growth arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress. Mutation of this pathway is thought to be nearly universal in human cancer. Researchers explored whether a retro-inverse p53C’ peptide (termed RI-TATp53C’) is a therapeutically effective means of activating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in preclinical models of terminal metastatic cancer. RI-TATp53C’ contains a protein transduction domain (PTD), which is capable of traversing the plasma membrane, and a functional sequence of the p53 C-terminus. A non-functional RI-TATp53C’ was developed by mutating the functional residues of the peptide. Researchers exposed TA3/St mammary carcinoma cells to Wild-Type RI- TATp53C’ and the mutant peptide of RI-TATp53C’. The cells’ DNA content was then analyzed to test if cell cycle arrest occurred They made a this is going to be a Researchers then explored the dependency of RI-TATp53C’ induction of growth arrest with endogenous p53 in cells (Figure 2). TA3/St and H1299 are both cancer cell lines.
*$%pass: Second experiment, asks: “Does RI- TATp53C’ depend on endogenous p53?” Probably going to manipulate endogenous p53 (IV) and measure RI- TATp53C’ effects (DV).

Treatment of terminal peritoneal carcinomatosis by a transducible p53-activating peptide. What stage of the cell cycle does RI-TATp53C’ arrest the cell in and does RI- TATp53C’-induced cell arrest require endogenous p53? To answer this question we need to determine the relationship between RI- TATp53Cʹ and the cell cycle, as well as the relationship between RI-TATp53Cʹ and endogenous p53. With such an in-depth question it’s worth considering the bigger picture to ensure that we understand the concepts and experiments in the passage. Start with the context: why are these experiments being done? As stated in paragraphs 1 and 2, p53 is a tumor-suppressing pathway that researchers are hoping to activate as a treatment to cancer. Both experiments, although distinct, will explore the activation of this pathway. Keeping in mind the independent and dependent variables of the two experiments that we identified as we read, we can identify which experiment should be used to answer each question in the prompt. The first experiment has three conditions: Vehicle, WT, and Mut. The vehicle condition is something we should recognize as bio talk for “we did everything the same as the treatment condition, except the treatment,” so this is a negative control. The WT condition, according to the second to last sentence in paragraph 2, is functional RI-TATp53Cʹ. This is the treatment group!
*$%pass: If the hypothesis at the start of the 2nd paragraph is correct we should see interesting data here. The Mut condition is described in the third to last and second to last sentences of paragraph 2 as a non-functional mutant RI- TATp53Cʹ. In each of these conditions, the proportion of cells that have low/medium/high DNA content are measured, which, according to the last sentence of paragraph 2, determines if cell cycle arrest occurred. At this point, we know Exp 1 relates RI-TATp53Cʹ (IV) and the cell cycle (DV) and should, therefore, be used to answer the first question of the prompt. Let’s analyze the data from the first experiment. Looking at Figure 1, notice that the Vehicle and Mutant conditions are identical, while the WT (treatment) condition differs greatly. Specifically, the RI-TATp53Cʹ treatment (WT) results in a larger portion of cells having less DNA. Considering our background knowledge about the cell cycle and each phase’s relative DNA content, we can deduce that G1 has the lowest DNA content. This is because G1 occurs after a division (decreases DNA) and before S phase (increases DNA). Thus, we can conclude RI-TATp53Cʹ must arrest the cell in G1. In order to answer the second question, the relationship between RI-TATp53Cʹ functionality and endogenous p53 must be determined. This aligns pretty well with paragraph 3’s description of experiment 2, and is a solid indication that we need to analyze Figure 2. Looking at the titles of the graphs there are two different cancerous cell cultures, TA3/St (p53 +/+) and H1299 (p53 -/-), which differ in their expression of p53. This is the first independent variable. Analyzing the graphs further, there are two additional independent variables, WT (light blue) vs. Mut (dark blue) and peptide concentration, [Peptide].
*$%pass: The dependent variable in Figure 2 is the Cell # or % untreated. In other words, it’s the number of cancerous cells that are unarrested and thus still cancerous after peptide With an understanding of the variables, let’s take a look at the data in Figure 2. Between the two graphs, the most striking difference is WT RI-TATp53Cʹ treatment in p53 +/+ cancerous cells results in a drastic drop in untreated (cancerous) cells (light blue, 1st graph), while in the p53 -/- condition WT RI- TATp53Cʹ cancerous cell levels remain constant (light blue, 2nd graph). This shows us that the ability of WT RI-TATp53C’ to induce cell cycle arrest is dependent on endogenous p53. In addition, when both p53 +/+ and p53 -/- conditions are exposed to the mutant RI-TATp53C’ (non-functional), there is no drop in cancerous cells. This second point is to be expected, but is still worth noting, as it shows us that nothing unexpected occurred during the experiment. Thus, given the data in Figure 2, we can conclude that in order for RI-TATp53C’ to induce cell arrest, it requires endogenous p53 in the tumor. Overall, Figure 1 shows that not only does WT RI-TATp53Cʹ induce cell arrest, but based on the increased proportion of cells with lower DNA content, it induces cell arrest in G1. From Figure 2, we were able to determine that RI-TATp53Cʹ requires a functional p53 pathway in order to induce cell arrest due to the loss of RI-TATp53Cʹ functionality in the p53 -/- condition. MCAT Concept Check 2.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are the five stages of the cell cycle? What happens in each stage? Cell Cycle Stage Features 2. What are the four phases of mitosis? What happens in each phase?
*$%pass: Mitotic Phase Features After Chapter 2.2, you will be able to: Predict the ploidy of daughter cells at the end of mitosis, meiosis I, and Differentiate between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids Compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis Explain the importance of crossing over events in relation to genetic Whereas mitosis occurs in somatic tissue and results in two identical daughter cells, meiosis occurs in gametocytes (germ cells) and results in up to four nonidentical sex cells (gametes). Meiosis shares some similarities with mitosis. In both processes, for instance, genetic material must be duplicated, chromatin is condensed to form chromosomes, and microtubules emanating from centrioles are involved in dividing genetic material. However, the MCAT tends to ask about the differences between these two processes. In contrast to mitosis, which consists of one round each of replication and division, meiosis consists of one round of replication followed by two rounds of division, as shown in Figure 2.5. Meiosis I results in homologous chromosomes being separated, generating haploid daughter cells; this is known as reductional division. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis, in that it results in the separation of sister chromatids without a change in ploidy, and is therefore known as diagram of meiosis as described subsequently in the chapter Figure 2.5 Meiosis Meiosis results in up to four nonidentical daughter The human genome is composed of 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes (homologues), each of which contains one chromosome inherited from each parent. This brings up an important note about terminology: whereas homologous pairs are considered separate chromosomes (such as maternal chromosome 15 and paternal chromosome 15), sister chromatids are identical strands of DNA connected at the centromere. Thus, after S phase, there are 92 chromatids organized into 46 chromosomes, which are organized into 23 homologous pairs.
*$%pass: During prophase I, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the spindle apparatus forms, and the nucleoli and nuclear membrane disappear. The first major difference between meiosis and mitosis occurs at this point: homologous chromosomes come together and intertwine in a process called synapsis. At this point, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so each synaptic pair contains four chromatids and is referred to as a tetrad; the homologous chromosomes are held together by a group of proteins called the synaptonemal complex. Chromatids of homologous chromosomes may break at the point of contact, called the chiasma (plural: chiasmata) and exchange equivalent pieces of DNA, as shown in Figure 2.6. This process is called crossing over, and can be characterized by the number of crossover events that occur in one strand of DNA, including single crossovers and double crossovers. Note that crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes and not between sister chromatids of the same chromosome—the latter are identical, so crossing over would not produce any change. Those chromatids involved are left with an altered but structurally complete set of genes. Such genetic recombination can unlink linked genes, thereby increasing the variety of genetic combinations that can be produced via gametogenesis. Linkage refers to the tendency for genes to be inherited together; genes that are located farther from each other physically are less likely to be inherited together, and more likely to undergo crossing over relative to each other. Thus, as opposed to asexual reproduction, which produces identical offspring, sexual reproduction provides the advantage of great genetic diversity, which is believed to increase the ability of a species to evolve and adapt to a changing environment.
*$%pass: homologous chromosomes align, forming a tetrad; crossing over occurs at chiasma, forming recombinant chromosomes Figure 2.6 Synapsis During prophase I, homologous chromosomes can exchange genetic material via crossing over. The rate of gene unlinking is used to map differences between two genes on the same chromosome. The farther apart two genes are, the more likely they are to become unlinked during crossing over. These statistics can then be used to determine the distance between genes on the chromosome, measured in units Because of crossing over, each daughter cell will have a unique pool of alleles (genes coding for alternative forms of a given trait) from a random mixture of maternal and paternal origin. In classical genetics, crossing over explains Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment), which states that the inheritance of one allele has no effect on the likelihood of inheriting certain alleles for other genes. During metaphase I, homologous pairs (tetrads) align at the metaphase plate, and each pair attaches to a separate spindle fiber by its kinetochore. Note the difference from mitosis: in mitosis, each chromosome is lined up on the metaphase plate by two spindle fibers (one from each pole); in meiosis, homologous chromosomes are lined up across from each other at the metaphase plate and are held by one spindle fiber. During anaphase I, homologous pairs separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. This process is called disjunction, and it accounts for Mendel’s first law (of segregation). During disjunction, each chromosome of paternal origin separates (or disjoins) from its homologue of maternal origin, and either chromosome can end up in either daughter cell. Thus, the distribution of homologous chromosomes to the two intermediate daughter cells is random with respect to parental origin.
*$%pass: This separating of the two homologous chromosomes is referred to as segregation. It is critical to understand how meiosis I is different from mitosis. The chromosome number is halved (reductional division) in meiosis I, and the daughter cells have the haploid number of chromosomes (23 in humans). Meiosis II is similar to mitosis in that sister chromatids are separated from one another; therefore, no change in ploidy is observed. During telophase I, a nuclear membrane forms around each new nucleus. At this point, each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The cells are now haploid; once homologous chromosomes separate, only n chromosomes are found in each daughter cell (23 in humans). The cell divides into two daughter cells by cytokinesis. Between cell divisions, there may be a short rest period, or interkinesis, during which the chromosomes partially If, during anaphase I or II of meiosis, homologous chromosomes (anaphase I) or sister chromatids (anaphase II) fail to separate, one of the resulting gametes will have two copies of a particular chromosome and the other gamete will have none. Subsequently, during fertilization, the resulting zygote may have too many or too few copies of that chromosome. Nondisjunction can affect both autosomal chromosomes (such as trisomy 21, resulting in Down syndrome) and the sex chromosomes (such as Klinefelter and Turner syndromes). Meiosis II is very similar to mitosis in that sister chromatids—rather than homologues—are separated from each other. During prophase II, the nuclear envelope dissolves, nucleoli disappear, the centrioles migrate to opposite poles, and the spindle apparatus begins to form. During metaphase II, the chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. During anaphase II, the centromeres divide, separating the chromosomes into sister chromatids. These chromatids are pulled to opposite poles by spindle fibers.
*$%pass: 2n 2n 2n n Occurs in all dividing cells Occurs in sex cells only do not pair Homologous chro mosomes align on opposite sides of the metaphase plate No crossing over Crossing over can occur During telophase II, a nuclear membrane forms around each new nucleus. Cytokinesis follows, and two daughter cells are formed. Thus, by completion of meiosis II, up to four haploid daughter cells are produced per gametocyte. We use the phrase up to because oogenesis, discussed later in this chapter, may result in fewer than four cells if an egg remains unfertilized after ovulation. MCAT Concept Check 2.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What is the number and ploidy of the daughter cells produced from meiosis I? From meiosis II? 2. What is the difference between homologous chromosomes and sister 3. For each phase of meiosis I listed below, what are the differences from the analogous phase of mitosis? Meiotic Phase Differences from Mitotic Phase 2.3 The Reproductive System High-Yield After Chapter 2.3, you will be able to: Recall the functions of the interstitial cells of Leydig and Sertoli cells Identify the phases of meiosis in which primary and secondary oocytes are Describe the acrosome Differentiate between male and female sex organs and development Recall the phases of the menstrual cycle, including key features and relative hormone levels for each phase: phases of the ovarian cycle Chromosomal sex is determined by the 23rd pair of chromosomes, with XX being female and XY being male. Ova can only carry the X chromosome, while sperm can carry either the X or Y chromosome. The X chromosome carries a sizeable amount of genetic information; mutations in these genes can cause sex- linked (X-linked) disorders.
*$%pass: Males are termed hemizygous with respect to many of the genes on the X chromosome because they only have one copy. Therefore, a male with a disease-causing allele on the unpaired part of X chromosome will necessarily express that allele. Females, on the other hand, may be homozygous or heterozygous with respect to genes on the X chromosome. Most X-linked disorders are recessively inherited; therefore, females express these disorders far less frequently than males. Females carrying a diseased allele on an X chromosome but not exhibiting the disease are said to be carriers. Sex-linked is X-linked. Comparatively, the Y chromosome contains very little genetic information. One notable gene on the Y chromosome is SRY (sex-determining region Y), which codes for a transcription factor that initiates testis differentiation and, thus, the formation of male gonads. Therefore, in the absence of the Y chromosome, all zygotes will be female. In the presence of the Y chromosome a zygote will be There are actually a handful of Y-linked diseases, most of which result in reduced fertility. A father will pass a Y-linked disease to all of his sons, assuming fertility has not been lost. These diseases are extremely rare and are not included on the official MCAT content lists. Male Reproductive Anatomy The male reproductive system is shown in Figure 2.7. labeled: ureter, urinary bladder, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, prostate gland, bulbourethral gland, urethra, Figure 2.7 Male Reproductive System Pathway of sperm through the male reproductive system: SEVE(N) UP Vas deferens (also called the ductus deferens) In males, the primitive gonads develop into the testes. The testes have two functional components: the seminiferous tubules and the interstitial cells of Leydig. Sperm are produced in the highly coiled seminiferous tubules, where they are nourished by Sertoli cells.
*$%pass: The cells of Leydig secrete testosterone and other male sex hormones (androgens). The testes are located in the scrotum, an external pouch that hangs below the penis, a position that allows it to maintain a temperature 2°C to 4°C lower than the body. In fact, there is a layer of muscle around the vas deferens (ductus deferens) that can raise and lower the testis to maintain the proper temperature for sperm development. As sperm are formed they are passed to the epididymis, where their flagella gain motility, and they are then stored until ejaculation. During ejaculation, sperm travel through the vas deferens and enter the ejaculatory duct at the posterior edge of the prostate gland. The two ejaculatory ducts then fuse to form the urethra, which carries sperm through the penis as they exit the body. In males, the reproductive and urinary systems share a common pathway; this is not the case in females. The prostate often enlarges with age and frequently causes problems in older males, including a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia. Because the prostate surrounds the urethra, classic symptoms of this condition include urinary frequency, urgency, and nighttime awakenings to use the bathroom. As sperm pass through the reproductive tract they are mixed with seminal fluid, which is produced through a combined effort by the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral gland. The seminal vesicles contribute fructose to nourish sperm, and both the seminal vesicles and prostate gland give the fluid mildly alkaline properties so the sperm can survive in the relative acidity of the female reproductive tract. The bulbourethral (Cowper’s) glands produce a clear viscous fluid that cleans out any remnants of urine and lubricates the urethra during sexual arousal.
*$%pass: The combination of sperm and seminal fluid is known as As mentioned above, spermatogenesis, the formation of haploid sperm through meiosis, occurs in the seminiferous tubules. In males, the diploid stem cells are known as spermatogonia. After replicating their genetic material (S stage), they develop into diploid primary spermatocytes. The first meiotic division will result in haploid secondary spermatocytes, which then undergo meiosis II to generate haploid spermatids. Finally, the spermatids undergo maturation to become mature spermatozoa. Spermatogenesis results in four functional sperm for each spermatogonium. Mature sperm are very compact. They consist of a head (containing the genetic material), a midpiece (which generates ATP from fructose), and a flagellum (for motility), as shown in Figure 2.8. The midpiece is filled with mitochondria, which generate the energy for swimming through the female reproductive tract to reach the ovum in the fallopian tubes. Each sperm head is covered by a cap known as an acrosome. This structure is derived from the Golgi apparatus and is necessary to penetrate the ovum. Once a male reaches sexual maturity during puberty, approximately 3 million sperm are produced per day, which typically continues throughout the course of that individual’s lifespan. labeled: head with acrosome and nucleus, midpiece with centriole and mitochondria, tail with axial filament, end piece Figure 2.8 Structure of a Mature Sperm Female Reproductive Anatomy Female reproductive organs are primarily internal, as shown in Figure 2.9. The gonads, known as ovaries, produce estrogen and progesterone. The ovaries are located in the pelvic cavity; each consists of thousands of follicles, which are multilayered sacs that contain, nourish, and protect immature ova (eggs). Between puberty and menopause, one egg per month is ovulated into the peritoneal sac, which lines the abdominal cavity.
*$%pass: It is then drawn into the fallopian tube or oviduct, which is lined with cilia to propel the egg forward. The fallopian tubes are connected to the muscular uterus, which is the site of fetal development. The lower end of the uterus, known as the cervix, connects to the vaginal canal, where sperm are deposited during intercourse. The vagina is also the passageway through which childbirth can occur. The external parts of the female genital organs are known collectively as the vulva. As mentioned earlier, females have separate excretory and reproductive tracts. labeled: ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, endometrium, cervix, vagina Figure 2.9 Female Reproductive System The production of female gametes is known as oogenesis. Although gametocytes undergo the same meiotic process in both females and males, there are some significant differences, too. First, there is no unending supply of stem cells analogous to spermatogonia in females; all of the oogonia a female will ever have are formed during fetal development. By birth, all of the oogonia have already undergone DNA replication and are considered primary oocytes. These cells are 2n, like primary spermatocytes, and are actually arrested in prophase I. After menarche (the first menstrual cycle), one primary oocyte per month will complete meiosis I, producing a secondary oocyte and a polar body. The division is characterized by unequal cytokinesis, which distributes ample cytoplasm to one daughter cell (the secondary oocyte) and nearly none to the other (the polar body). The polar body generally does not divide any further and will never produce functional gametes. The secondary oocyte, on the other hand, remains arrested in metaphase II and does not complete the remainder of meiosis II unless Oocytes are surrounded by two layers: the zona pellucida and the corona radiata.
*$%pass: The zona pellucida surrounds the oocyte itself and is an acellular mixture of glycoproteins that protects the oocyte and contains compounds necessary for sperm cell binding. The corona radiata lies outside the zona pellucida and is a layer of cells that adheres to the oocyte during ovulation. Meiosis II is triggered when a sperm cell penetrates these layers with the help of acrosomal enzymes. The secondary oocyte undergoes the second meiotic division to split into a mature ovum and another polar body, which will eventually be broken down. A mature ovum is a very large cell consisting of large quantities of cytoplasm and organelles. The ovum contributes nearly everything to the zygote (half of the DNA and all of the cytoplasm, organelles [including mitochondria], and RNA for early cellular processes), and sperm contribute half of the DNA. Upon completion of meiosis II, the haploid pronuclei of the sperm and the ovum join, creating a diploid zygote. The ability to reproduce is under hormonal control. Prior to puberty, the hypothalamus restricts production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). At the start of puberty, this restriction is lifted as the hypothalamus releases pulses of GnRH, which then triggers the anterior pituitary gland to synthesize and release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones trigger the production of other sex hormones that develop and maintain the reproductive system. Male Sexual Development During the fetal period (from nine weeks after fertilization until birth), presence of the Y chromosome leads to production of androgens, resulting in male sexual differentiation. For the duration of infancy and childhood, androgen production is low. Testosterone, produced by the testes, increases dramatically during puberty, and sperm production begins. In order to achieve this, there is a delicate interplay of FSH and LH stimulation on two cell types in the testes.
*$%pass: FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells and triggers sperm maturation, whereas LH causes the interstitial cells to produce testosterone. Testosterone not only develops and maintains the male reproductive system, but also results in the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as facial and axillary hair, deepening of the voice, and increased muscle and bone mass. Testosterone production remains high into adulthood and then declines with age. This hormone exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary so that production is kept within an If the receptors for testosterone are absent or defective, it cannot exert its effects. The result is a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), in which a chromosomal male (XY) has female secondary sexual characteristics. In complete androgen insensitivity, a chromosomal male will appear female at birth. Oftentimes the diagnosis of AIS is not made until puberty, when amenorrhea (failure to menstruate) manifests. Female Sexual Development The ovaries, which are derived from the same embryonic structures as the testes, are also under the control of FSH and LH secreted by the anterior pituitary. The ovaries produce estrogens and progesterone. Estrogens are secreted in response to FSH and result in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and female secondary sexual characteristics (breast growth, widening of the hips, changes in fat distribution). In the embryo, estrogens stimulate development of the reproductive tract. In adults, estrogens lead to the thickening of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) each month in preparation for the implantation of a zygote. Estrogen establishes and progesterone protects the endometrium. Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum—the remains of the ovarian follicle following ovulation—in response to LH. Interestingly, progesterone is involved in the development and maintenance of the endometrium, but not in the initial thickening of the endometrium—this is the role of estrogen.
*$%pass: This means that both estrogen and progesterone are required for the generation, development, and maintenance of an endometrium capable of supporting a zygote. By the end of the first trimester of a pregnancy, progesterone is supplied by the placenta, while the corpus luteum atrophies and ceases to function. The Menstrual Cycle During the reproductive years (from menarche to menopause), estrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall in a cyclic pattern. In response, the endometrial lining will grow and be shed. This is known as the menstrual cycle and can be divided into four events, as shown in Figure 2.10: the follicular phase, ovulation, the luteal phase, and menstruation. Figure 2.10 The Menstrual Cycle (a) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) facilitates the maturation of a single ovum; (b) The peak of luteinizing hormone (LH) around day 14 marks ovulation, the release of the oocyte from the follicle; (c) The endometrial lining of the uterus reaches its peak in the luteal phase and is shed at the beginning of the The MCAT likes to test your ability to identify graphs of the blood concentrations of FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle. Be sure to know when each peaks by studying Figure 2.10. The follicular phase begins when the menstrual flow, which sheds the uterine lining of the previous cycle, begins. GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus increases in response to the decreased concentrations of estrogen and progesterone, which fall off toward the end of each cycle. The higher concentrations of GnRH cause increased secretions of both FSH and LH. These two hormones work in concert to develop several ovarian follicles. The follicles begin to produce estrogen, which has negative feedback effects and causes the GnRH, LH, and FSH concentrations to level off.
*$%pass: Estrogen glandularization of the Estrogen is interesting in that it can have both negative and positive feedback effects. Late in the follicular phase, the developing follicles secrete higher and higher concentrations of estrogen. Eventually, estrogen concentrations reach a threshold that paradoxically results in positive feedback, and GnRH, LH, and FSH levels spike. The surge in LH is important; it induces ovulation, the release of the ovum from the ovary into the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are simply estrogen/progesterone (or progesterone-only) preparations. These block conception by inhibiting LH and FSH release through negative feedback, thereby inhibiting ovulation. When taking the placebo pills at the end of the month, withdrawal menstruation still occurs because estrogen and progesterone levels drop, but no egg passes with the After ovulation, LH causes the ruptured follicle to form the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Remember that estrogen helps regenerate the uterine lining, but progesterone maintains it for implantation. Progesterone levels begin to rise, while estrogen levels remain high. The high levels of progesterone cause negative feedback on GnRH, FSH, and LH, preventing the ovulation of multiple Assuming that implantation does not occur, the corpus luteum loses its stimulation from LH, progesterone levels decline, and the uterine lining is sloughed off. The loss of high levels of estrogen and progesterone removes the block on GnRH so that the next cycle can begin.
*$%pass: Follicles mature during the follicular phase (FSH, LH) LH surge at midcycle triggers ovulation Ruptured follicle becomes corpus luteum, which secretes estrogen and progesterone to build up uterine lining in preparation for implantation; LH and FSH are inhibited If fertilization does not occur, corpus luteum atrophies, progesterone and estrogen levels decrease, menses occurs, and LH and FSH levels begin to On the other hand, if fertilization has occurred the resulting zygote will develop into a blastocyst that will implant in the uterine lining and secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), an analog of LH—it looks very similar chemically and can stimulate LH receptors. This maintains the corpus luteum. hCG is critical during first trimester development because the estrogen and progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum keep the uterine lining in place. By the second trimester, hCG levels decline because the placenta has grown to a sufficient size to secrete enough progesterone and estrogen by itself. The high levels of estrogen and progesterone continue to serve as negative feedback on With aging, the ovaries become less sensitive to FSH and LH, resulting in ovarian atrophy. As estrogen and progesterone levels drop, the endometrium also atrophies, and menstruation stops. Also, because the negative feedback on FSH and LH is removed, the blood levels of these two hormones rise. This is called menopause. Profound physical and physiological changes usually accompany this process, including flushing, hot flashes, bloating, and headaches. Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.

(Note: Draw in symbols to signify the levels of each hormone, such as , =, and ) Phase Key Features FSH LH Estrogen Progesterone In this chapter, we explored one of the key tenets of the cell theory—how cells produce more copies of themselves. We first examined mitosis, which results in genetically identical diploid daughter cells. We then moved on to meiosis, which results in genetically nonidentical haploid daughter cells, or gametes. We then looked at the male and female reproductive systems, which form these gametes, each of which contains half of the normal complement of genetic information. Finally, we explored basic reproductive endocrinology and saw how testosterone and estrogen are key in the development of the reproductive systems and the secondary sex characteristics that develop at puberty. Formation of gametes is only half the story, of course. It serves us no good as a species to form sex cells if the cells cannot interact to form another human. Ultimately, gametes must accomplish their purpose: passing on the genes, the instructions for life, from one generation to another. Thus, we turn our attention in the next chapter to the next steps of fertilization, embryogenesis, and birth.
*$%pass: Indeed, it is through the union of one egg and one sperm that every human being on the planet today—and since the beginning of the human race—came You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online The Cell Cycle and Mitosis Diploid (2n) cells have two copies of each chromosome; haploid (n) cells have one copy. The cell cycle contains five stages. The G1, S, and G2 stages are collectively called interphase, during which the DNA is uncoiled in the form of In the G1 stage (presynthetic gap), cells create organelles for energy and protein production, and increase their size. The restriction point, during which the DNA is checked for quality, must be passed for the cell to move into the S stage. In the S stage (synthesis), DNA is replicated. The strands of DNA, called chromatids, are held together at the centromere. In the G2 stage (postsynthetic gap), there is further cell growth and replication of organelles in preparation for mitosis. Another quality checkpoint must be passed for the cell to enter into mitosis. In the M stage (mitosis), mitosis and cytokinesis occur. In the G0 stage, the cell performs its functions without preparing for p53 plays a role in the two major checkpoints of the cell cycle (G1 to S, and G2 to M). Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) rise and fall during the cell cycle. Cyclins bind to CDKs, phosphorylating and activating transcription factors for the next stage of the cell cycle. Cancer occurs when cell cycle control becomes deranged, allowing damaged cells to undergo mitosis without regard to quality or quantity of the new cells produced.
*$%pass: Cancerous cells may begin to produce factors that allow them to delocalize and invade adjacent tissues or metastasize elsewhere. Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells from a single cell and occurs in somatic cells. Mitosis has four phases: In prophase, the chromosomes condense, the nuclear membrane dissolves, nucleoli disappear, centrioles migrate to opposite sides of the cell, and the spindle apparatus begins to form. The kinetochore of each chromosome is contacted by a spindle fiber. In metaphase, chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate In anaphase, sister chromatids are separated and pulled to opposite In telophase, the nuclear membrane reforms, spindle apparatus disappears, and cytosol and organelles are split between the two daughter cells through cytokinesis. Meiosis occurs in gametocytes (germ cells) and produces up to four nonidentical haploid sex cells (gametes). Meiosis has one round of replication and two rounds of division (the reductional and equational divisions). In meiosis I, homologous pairs of chromosomes (homologues) are separated from each other. Homologues are chromosomes that are given the same number, but are of opposite parental origin. In prophase I, the same events occur as in prophase of mitosis, except that homologues come together and intertwine in a process called synapsis. The four chromatids are referred to as a tetrad, and crossing over exchanges genetic material between one chromatid and material from a chromatid in the homologous chromosome. This accounts for Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment). In metaphase I, homologous chromosomes line up on opposite sides of the metaphase plate. In anaphase I, homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. This accounts for Mendel’s first law (of segregation). In telophase I, the chromosomes may or may not fully decondense, and the cell may enter interkinesis after cytokinesis.
*$%pass: In meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated from each other in a process that is functionally identical to mitosis. Sister chromatids are copies of the same DNA held together at the centromere. The Reproductive System Chromosomal sex is determined by the 23rd pair of chromosomes in humans, with XX being female and XY being male. The X chromosome carries a sizeable amount of genetic information; mutations of X-linked genes can cause sex-linked disorders. Males are hemizygous with respect to the unpaired genes on the X chromosome, so they will express sex-linked disorders, even if they only have one recessive disease-carrying allele. Females with only one copy of the affected allele are called carriers. The Y chromosome carries little genetic information, but does contain the SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene, which causes the gonads to differentiate into testes. The male reproductive system contains both internal and external structures. Sperm develop in the seminiferous tubules in the testes. They are nourished by Sertoli cells. Interstitial cells of Leydig, in the testes, secrete testosterone and other male sex hormones (androgens). The testes are located in the scrotum, which hangs outside of the abdominal cavity and has a temperature 2°C to 4°C lower than the rest of the body. Once formed, sperm gain motility in the epididymis and are stored there until ejaculation. During ejaculation, sperm travel through the vas deferens to the ejaculatory duct, and then to the urethra and out through the penis. The seminal vesicles contribute fructose to nourish sperm and produce The prostate gland also produces alkaline fluid. The bulbourethral glands produce a clear viscous fluid that cleans out any remnants of urine and lubricates the urethra during sexual arousal. Semen is composed of sperm and seminal fluid from the glands above.
*$%pass: In spermatogenesis, four haploid sperm are produced from a After S stage, the germ cells are called primary spermatocytes. After meiosis I, the germ cells are called secondary spermatocytes. After meiosis II, the germ cells are called spermatids. After maturation, the germ cells are called spermatozoa. Sperm contain a head, midpiece, and flagellum. The head contains the genetic material and is covered with an acrosome—a modified Golgi apparatus that contains enzymes that help the sperm fuse with and penetrate the ovum. The midpiece generates ATP from fructose and contains many The flagellum promotes motility. The female reproductive system primarily contains internal structures. Ova (eggs) are produced in follicles in the ovaries. Once each month, an egg is ovulated into the peritoneal sac and is drawn into the fallopian tube or oviduct. The fallopian tubes are connected to the uterus, the lower end of which is the cervix. The vaginal canal lies below the cervix and is the site where sperm are deposited during intercourse. The vaginal canal also can be the site of childbirth. The external parts of the female genital organs are collectively known as the vulva. In oogenesis, one haploid ovum and a variable number of polar bodies are formed from an oogonium. At birth, all oogonia have already undergone replication and are considered primary oocytes. They are arrested in prophase I. The ovulated egg each month is a secondary oocyte, which is arrested in metaphase II. If the oocyte is fertilized, it will complete meiosis II to become a true Cytokinesis is uneven in oogenesis. The cell receiving very little cytoplasm and organelles is called a polar body.
*$%pass: Oocytes are surrounded by the zona pellucida, an acellular mixture of glycoproteins that protects the oocyte and contains the compounds necessary for sperm binding; and the corona radiata, which is a layer of cells that adheres to the oocyte during ovulation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus causes the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the functions of which depend on the sex of the individual. In males, FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells and triggers spermatogenesis, while LH causes the interstitial cells to produce testosterone. Testosterone is responsible for the maintenance and development of the male reproductive system and male secondary sex characteristics (facial and axillary hair, deepening of the voice, and increased bone and In females, FSH stimulates development of the ovarian follicles, while LH causes ovulation. These hormones also stimulate production of estrogens and progesterone. The menstrual cycle is a periodic growth and shedding of the endometrial In the follicular phase, GnRH secretion stimulates FSH and LH secretion, which promotes follicle development. Estrogen is released, stimulating vascularization and glandularization of the decidua. Ovulation is stimulated by a sudden surge in LH. This surge is triggered when estrogen levels reach a threshold and switch from negative to positive feedback effects. In the luteal phase, LH causes the ruptured follicle to become the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone that maintains the uterine lining. High estrogen and progesterone levels cause negative feedback on GnRH, LH, and FSH. Menstruation occurs if there is no fertilization. As the estrogen and progesterone levels drop, the endometrial lining is sloughed off, and the block on GnRH production is removed. If fertilization does occur, the blastula produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which, as an LH analog, can maintain the corpus luteum.
*$%pass: Near the end of the first trimester, hCG levels drop as the placenta takes over progesterone production. Menopause occurs when the ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, usually between ages 45 and 55. Menstruation stops and FSH and LH levels rise. Physical and physiological changes accompanying menopause include flushing, hot flashes, bloating, headaches, and Answers to Concept Checks Cell grows and performs its normal functions. DNA is examined DNA is replicated. Cell continues to grow and replicates organelles in preparation for mitosis. Cell continues to perform its normal functions. Mitosis (cell division) occurs.

After meiosis I, there are two haploid daughter cells. After meiosis II, there are up to four haploid gametes. 2. Homologous chromosomes are related chromosomes of opposite parental origin (such as maternal chromosome 15 and paternal chromosome 15, or— in males—the X and Y chromosomes). Sister chromatids are identical copies of the same DNA that are held together at the centromere. After S phase, a cell contains 92 chromatids, 46 chromosomes, and 23 homologous pairs.
*$%pass: Differences from Mitotic Phase Prophase I Homologous chromosomes come together as tetrads during synapsis; crossing over Homologous chromosomes line up on opposite sides of the metaphase plate, rather than individual chromosomes lining up on the metaphase plate Homologous chromosomes separate from each other; centromeres do not break Chromatin may or may not decondense; interkinesis occurs as the cell prepares for meiosis II 1.

A primary oocyte is arrested in prophase I, while a secondary oocyte is arrested in metaphase II. 3. The acrosome contains enzymes that are capable of penetrating the corona radiata and zona pellucida of the ovum, permitting fertilization to occur. It is a modified Golgi apparatus. 4. Androgens, such as testosterone, lead to male sexual differentiation. Absence of androgen receptors, a condition known as androgen insensitivity syndrome, leads to an XY genotype with phenotypically female FSH LH Estrogen Progesterone Egg develops, endometrial lining becomes vascularized , then Ovulation Egg is released from follicle into peritoneal cavity Corpus luteum produces progesterone to maintain Shedding of endometrial Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Diploid cells called spermatogonia differentiate into primary spermatocytes, which undergo the first meiotic division to yield two haploid secondary spermatocytes. These undergo a second meiotic division to become immature spermatids. The spermatids then undergo a series of changes leading to the production of mature sperm, or spermatozoa. From the time of birth until shortly before ovulation, all egg cells are arrested at the prophase stage of meiosis I. These cells are referred to as primary oocytes. At ovulation, the egg cell has completed meiosis I and is now arrested in metaphase II as a haploid cell called a secondary oocyte.
*$%pass: When a sperm penetrates the outer layers of the secondary oocyte, it completes meiosis II to become a mature ovum. The spindle apparatus first interacts with the kinetochore fibers near the end of prophase. While the spindle apparatus aligns the chromosomes at the equatorial plate during metaphase, (B), the initial connection of the microtubule to the kinetochore occurs in prophase. To ensure that the labeled deoxyadenine will be incorporated into the DNA of one of the daughter cells, we have to insert the nucleotide before DNA replication has been completed. Because replication occurs during S stage, we could introduce the deoxyadenine during G1 or S stage. Because G1 precedes S, the latest point at which the deoxyadenine could be added is the Estrogen is known to cause growth of the endometrial lining during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and its levels stay high during the luteal phase to promote vascularization and glandularization of this tissue. Excessive levels of estrogen may provide a strong enough signal for cell growth to promote tumor formation or even cancer. The other tissues listed in this question require estrogen for development, but are not strongly dependent on estrogen for growth. This subtle point about ovulation is missed by most students and remains hard to believe until the organs are examined in anatomy class in medical school. The ruptured ovarian follicle releases an oocyte into the abdominal cavity, close to the entrance of the fallopian tube. With the aid of beating cilia, the oocyte is drawn into the fallopian tube, through which it travels until it reaches the uterus. If it is fertilized in the fallopian tube, it will implant in the uterine wall. If fertilization does not occur, it will be expelled along with the uterine lining during menstruation.
*$%pass: The question is asking us to determine at which points in the cell cycle we can prevent or at least lower the number of cells undergoing mitosis. One idea would be to prevent DNA synthesis during the S stage of the cell cycle. Without the DNA being replicated, two viable daughter cells could not be formed. Other ideas would be preventing the mitotic cycle from forming altogether in prophase by preventing spindle apparatus formation, preventing the nuclear membrane from dissolving, or interfering with other processes during this phase. Similarly, a treatment that would act on cells in the metaphase stage of the cell cycle would also interfere with the mitotic cycle. Therefore, any of the three solutions presented would be a viable The prostrate gland, along with the seminal vesicles and the bulbourethral gland, secretes seminal fluid that combines with sperm to produce semen. It is the cremaster muscle which surrounds the testes that raises and lowers the testes in response to changes in temperature. The first meiotic division (reductional division) pulls homologous chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase I. Near the end of telophase I, cytokinesis occurs, resulting in two haploid (n) daughter cells. Thus, during interkinesis and anaphase II, the daughter cells are already haploid, eliminating (C) and (D). The cell is diploid during interphase, (A), but remains diploid up until the end of telophase I. The safest way to answer this question correctly is to go through each answer choice and eliminate the ones that contribute to genetic variability.
*$%pass: The random fertilization of an egg by a sperm, the random segregation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I, and crossing over between homologous chromosomes during prophase I all contribute to genetic variability during sexual reproduction because they result in novel combinations of genetic material, eliminating (A), (B), and (C). S stage, (D), should not cause increased genetic variability; the DNA should be copied precisely, without error, meaning that both strands of DNA should be The key differences between mitosis and meiosis primarily appear during meiosis I. Of note, synapsis and crossing over occur during prophase I, and homologous chromosomes are separated during meiosis I (rather than sister chromatids, as in mitosis). While the location of the centromeres relative to the metaphase plate may seem trivial, it is representative of the fact that homologous chromosomes line up on opposite sides of the equatorial plate in meiosis, in contrast to the positioning of each chromosome directly upon the metaphase plate in mitosis. In prophase, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the spindle apparatus forms, and the nucleoli and nuclear membrane disappear. (A) describes anaphase, whereas (B) and (C) describe telophase. Nondisjunction refers to the incorrect segregation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I, or of sister chromatids during anaphase II. In either case, one daughter cell ends up with two copies of related genetic material, while the other receives zero. Immediately, this should eliminate (A) and (B), which show a normal complement of chromosomes (46). An individual who has only one recessive disease-carrying allele, and yet still expresses the disease, likely does not have a dominant allele for the given trait. This is seen in males, who are hemizygous for many X-linked genes, and can also be seen in females who have Turner syndrome (45,X) and only one X chromosome.
*$%pass: Thus, (C) is the answer. Progesterone peaks during the luteal phase, as it supports the endometrium for potential implantation of a blastula. Progesterone levels are relatively low during the follicular phase and ovulation, eliminating (A) and (B). Withdrawal of progesterone actually causes menses, eliminating (D). During the first trimester of pregnancy, the corpus luteum is preserved by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); hence, progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum is maintained during the first trimester. This eliminates (A). During the second trimester, hCG levels decline, but progesterone levels rise because the hormone is now secreted by the placenta itself, eliminating (B). High levels of progesterone and estrogen inhibit GnRH secretion, thus preventing FSH and LH secretion and the onset of a new menstrual cycle. This eliminates (C) and validates (D).

When used during pregnancy, the probe transduces an image onto a computer screen to determine gestational age, screen for multiple pregnancies or anomalies, and identify the baby’s phenotypical sex. The latter typically cannot be determined before 16 to 17 weeks without a blood test, because ultrasonography equipment does not have high enough resolution. In this chapter, we’ll continue the discussion from Chapter 2 by beginning with fertilization, the formation of a diploid zygote from the union of a sperm and an ovum. We’ll then follow development from this point until the birth of an autonomously breathing baby. We’ll examine how the cells of a developing human divide and differentiate. We’ll also explore some specific system differences that exist between developing fetuses and adults as we present an overview of the stages of pregnancy and childbirth. 3.1Early Developmental Stages After Chapter 3.1, you will be able to: Distinguish between determinate and indeterminate cleavage of a zygote Describe the process of implantation and the stage of development at which Connect the ectoderm, mesoderm, neural crest, and endoderm to the organs they will form Describe how induction influences development Recall the stages of embryonic development up to the gastrula: early stages of embryonic gastrulation In this first section, we will explore development from the formation of a diploid zygote until neurulation, or the formation of the neural tube that will differentiate into the nervous system.
*$%pass: As discussed in Chapter 2 of MCAT Biology Review, a secondary oocyte is ovulated from the follicle on approximately day 14 of the menstrual cycle. The secondary oocyte travels into the fallopian tube, where it can be fertilized up to 24 hours after ovulation. Fertilization, shown in Figure 3.1, usually occurs in the widest part of the fallopian tube, called the ampulla. When the sperm meets the secondary oocyte in the fallopian tube, it binds to the oocyte and releases acrosomal enzymes that enable the head of the sperm to penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida. The first sperm to come into direct contact with the secondary oocyte’s cell membrane forms a tube-like structure known as the acrosomal apparatus, which extends to and penetrates the cell membrane. Its pronucleus may then freely enter the oocyte once meiosis II has come to sperm attaching to egg, injecting pronucleus through acrosomal apparatus; cortical reaction Figure 3.1 Fertilization After penetration of the sperm through the cell membrane, the cortical reaction, a release of calcium ions, occurs. These calcium ions depolarize the membrane of the ovum, which serves two purposes: depolarization prevents fertilization of the ovum by multiple sperm cells, and the increased calcium concentration increases the metabolic rate of the newly formed diploid zygote. The now depolarized and impenetrable membrane is called the fertilization membrane. Twinning can occur by two different mechanisms. Dizygotic (fraternal) twins form from fertilization of two different eggs released during one ovulatory cycle by two different sperm. Each zygote will implant in the uterine wall, and each develops its own placenta, chorion, and amnion—these structures are discussed later in the chapter. If the zygotes implant close together, the placentas may grow onto each other. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than any other pair of siblings.
*$%pass: Monozygotic (identical) twins form when a single zygote splits into two. Because the genetic material is identical, the genomes of the offspring will be too. If division is incomplete, conjoined twins may result, where the two offspring are physically attached. Monozygotic twins can be classified by the number of structures they share. Monochorionic/monoamniotic twins share the same amnion and chorion. Monochorionic/diamniotic twins each have their own amnion, but share the same chorion. Dichorionic/diamniotic twins each have their own amnions and chorions. Which type of twinning occurs is a result of when the separation occurred. As more gestational structures are shared, there are more risks as the fetuses grow and develop. After fertilization in the fallopian tubes, the zygote must travel to the uterus for implantation. If it arrives too late, there will no longer be an endometrium capable of supporting the embryo. As it moves to the uterus for implantation, the zygote undergoes rapid mitotic cell divisions in a process called cleavage. The first cleavage officially creates an embryo, as it nullifies one of the zygote’s defining characteristics: unicellularity. Although several rounds of mitosis occur, the total size of the embryo remains unchanged during the first few divisions, as shown in Figure 3.2. By dividing into progressively smaller cells, the cells increase two ratios: the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio and the surface area- to-volume ratio. Thus, the cells achieve increased area for gas and nutrient exchange relative to overall volume. 8-cell embryo in fertilization membrane; stabilized by a pipette Figure 3.2 An 8-Cell Embryo The embryo has undergone three cleavage events at this point. There are two types of cleavage: indeterminate and determinate. Indeterminate cleavage results in cells that can still develop into complete organisms.
*$%pass: In fact, monozygotic twins have identical genomes because they both originate from indeterminately cleaved cells of the same embryo. Determinate cleavage results in cells with fates that are, as the term implies, already determined. In other words, these cells are committed to differentiating into a certain type of cell. Several divisions later, the embryo becomes a solid mass of cells known as a morula, as shown in Figure 3.3. This term comes from the Latin word for mulberry, which might help us grasp what an embryo at this stage looks like. many cells that appear to be partially fused Figure 3.3 Morula The morula is a solid ball of cells. Once the morula is formed, it undergoes blastulation, which forms the blastula, a hollow ball of cells with a fluid-filled inner cavity known as a blastocoel. The mammalian blastula is known as a blastocyst and consists of two noteworthy cell groups, the trophoblast and inner cell mass (as shown in Figure 3.4). The trophoblast cells surround the blastocoel and give rise to the chorion and later the placenta, whereas the inner cell mass protrudes into the blastocoel and gives rise to the organism itself. hollow ball of trophoblast cells with protruding inner cell mass Figure 3.4 Blastula The blastula contains a fluid-filled cavity called the Remember that a blastula is an embryo with a blasted-out cavity. The blastula moves through the fallopian tube to the uterus, where it burrows into the endometrium. The trophoblast cells are specialized to create an interface between the maternal blood supply and the developing embryo. These trophoblastic cells give rise to the chorion, an extraembryonic membrane that develops into the placenta. The trophoblasts form chorionic villi, which are microscopic finger-like projections that penetrate the endometrium.
*$%pass: As these chorionic villi develop into the placenta they support maternal–fetal gas exchange. The embryo is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, which consists of two arteries and one vein encased in a gelatinous substance. The vein carries freshly oxygenated blood rich with nutrients from the placenta to the embryo. The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood and waste to the placenta for exchange. Sometimes the blastula implants itself outside the uterus, a situation known as an ectopic pregnancy. Over 95% of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are generally not viable because the narrow fallopian tube is not an environment in which an embryo can properly grow. If the embryo does not spontaneously abort, the tube may rupture and a considerable amount of hemorrhaging may result. In fact, a suspected ectopic pregnancy is often a Until the placenta is functional, the embryo is supported by the yolk sac, which is also the site of early blood cell development. There are two other extraembryonic membranes that require discussion: the allantois and the amnion. The allantois is involved in early fluid exchange between the embryo and the yolk sac. Ultimately, the umbilical cord is formed from remnants of the yolk sac and the allantois. The allantois is surrounded by the amnion, a thin, tough membrane filled with amniotic fluid. This fluid serves as a shock absorber during pregnancy, lessening the impact of maternal motion on the developing embryo. In addition to forming the placenta, the chorion also forms an outer membrane around the amnion, adding an additional level of protection. The anatomy of these structures is shown in Figure 3.5.
*$%pass: fetus connected to placenta by umbilical cord; yolk sac, amnion, chorion, chorionic villi labeled Figure 3.5 Anatomy of Pregnancy Amniocentesis is the process of aspirating amniotic fluid by inserting a thin needle into the amniotic sac. The amniotic fluid contains fetal cells that can be examined for chromosomal abnormalities as well as sex determination. Amniocentesis is recommended for people who are over 35 and pregnant if earlier screening tests (blood tests and ultrasound) indicate a high chance of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Individuals in this age group have a higher rate of meiotic nondisjunction, which can result in genetic deviations such as Down syndrome. Once the cell mass implants it can begin further developmental processes such as gastrulation, the generation of three distinct cell layers. The early developmental processes up to this point are shown in Figure 3.6. Much of today’s understanding of development comes from the study of other organisms with varying degrees of similarity to human development. In sea urchins, gastrulation begins with a small invagination in the blastula. Cells continue moving toward the invagination, resulting in elimination of the blastocoel. To visualize this, imagine inflating a balloon and poking it with your finger. If you kept pushing, eventually the rubber from that side of the balloon would come into contact with the other side. If the two membranes could merge, as occurs in development, this would create a tube through the middle of the balloon. In living things, the result of this process is called a gastrula. The membrane invagination into the blastocoel is called the archenteron, which later develops into the gut. The opening of the archenteron is called the blastopore. In deuterostomes, such as humans, the blastopore develops into the anus.
*$%pass: In protostomes, it develops into fertilized egg cleaving to 16-cell stage, then becoming morula, blastula, and gastrula (with blastopore and archenteron) Figure 3.6 Early Stages of Embryonic Development How can we remember the blastopore’s fate in toddlers—deuterostome starts with deu, which looks like duo, meaning two. Thus, deuterostomes develop the anus—the orifice associated with “number two”—from the blastopore. Protostomes must start at the other end (the mouth). Primary Germ Layers Eventually, some cells will also migrate into what remains of the blastocoel. This establishes three layers of cells called primary germ layers. The outermost layer is called the ectoderm and gives rise to the integument, including the epidermis, hair, nails, and the epithelia of the nose, mouth, and lower anal canal. The lens of the eye, nervous system (including adrenal medulla), and inner ear are also derived from ectoderm. The middle layer is called the mesoderm and develops into several different systems including musculoskeletal, circulatory, and most of the excretory systems. Mesoderm also gives rise to the gonads as well as the muscular and connective tissue layers of the digestive and respiratory systems and the adrenal The innermost layer is called the endoderm and forms the epithelial linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts, including the lungs.
*$%pass: The pancreas, thyroid, bladder, and distal urinary tracts, as well as parts of the liver, are derived from The primary germ layers: Ectoderm—“attracto”derm (things that attract us to others, such as cosmetic features and “smarts”) Mesoderm—“means”oderm (the means of getting around as an organism, such as bones and muscle; the means of getting around in the body, such as the circulatory system; the means of getting around, such as the gonads) Endoderm—linings of “endernal” (internal) organs (the digestive and respiratory tract, and accessory organs attached to these systems) So how is it that cells with the same genes are able to develop into such distinctly different cell types with highly specialized functions? Primarily, it is by selective transcription of the genome. In other words, only the genes needed for that particular cell type are transcribed. Thus, in pancreatic islet cells the genes to produce specific hormones (insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin) are turned on, while these same genes are turned off in other cell types. Selective transcription is often related to the concept of induction, which is the ability of one group of cells to influence the fate of nearby cells. This process is mediated by chemical substances called inducers which diffuse from the organizing cells to the responsive cells. These chemicals are responsible for processes such as the guidance of neuronal axons. Induction also ensures the proximity of different cell types that work together within an organ. The MCAT likes to test on the dual embryonic origin of the adrenal glands. The adrenal cortex is derived from the mesoderm, but the adrenal medulla is derived from the ectoderm (because the adrenal medulla contains some nervous tissue). Once the three germ layers are formed, neurulation, or development of the nervous system, can begin.
*$%pass: Remember that the nervous system is derived from the ectoderm. How, then, do cells originating on the surface of the embryo (ectoderm) end up inside the final organism? First, a rod of mesodermal cells known as the notochord forms along the long axis of the organism like a primitive spine (in fact, remnants of notochord persist in the intervertebral discs between vertebrae). The notochord induces a group of overlying ectodermal cells to slide inward to form neural folds, which surround a neural groove, as shown in Figure 3.7. The neural folds grow toward one another until they fuse into a neural tube, which gives rise to the central nervous system. At the tip of each neural fold are neural crest cells. These cells migrate outward to form the peripheral nervous system (including the sensory ganglia, autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and Schwann cells) as well as specific cell types in other tissues (such as calcitonin-producing cells of the thyroid, melanocytes in the skin, and others). Finally, ectodermal cells will migrate over the neural tube and crest to cover the rudimentary nervous system. neural plate overlying notochord invaginates to form neural folds around neural groove, which forms neural tube and neural crest Figure 3.7 Formation of the Neural Tube Failure of the neural tube to close results in either spina bifida (in which some or all of the spinal cord may be exposed to the outside world) or anencephaly (in which the brain fails to develop and the skull is left open). The severity of spina bifida’s effects range from no significant distress to death, whereas anencephaly is universally fatal.
*$%pass: Individuals who are likely to get pregnant are encouraged to take folate (folic acid) to prevent this complication; furthermore, it is recommended that all individuals who could become pregnant supplement their diets with folate because neurulation often occurs before pregnancy is detected. Problems in Early Development Early development is a highly sensitive time. During this stage, as the germ layers are forming and as organogenesis (the production of organs) begins, teratogens may have far-reaching and highly detrimental effects. Teratogens are substances that interfere with development, causing defects or even death of the developing embryo. However, each teratogen will not have the same effect on every embryo or fetus. It is believed that the unique genetics of the embryo influences the effects of the teratogen. In addition to genetics, the route of exposure, length of exposure, rate of placental transmission of the teratogen, and the exact identity of the teratogen will also affect the outcome. Some common teratogens include alcohol, prescription drugs, viruses, bacteria, and environmental chemicals including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to teratogens, maternal health can also influence development. Certain conditions may cause changes in the overall physiology of the person who is pregnant, resulting in overexposure or underexposure of the embryo or fetus to certain chemicals. For example, pregnant individuals who have diabetes and hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) can have poor birth outcomes. Overexposure to sugar in utero can lead to a fetus that is too large to be delivered and that could become hypoglycemic soon after birth (due to synthesizing very high levels of insulin to compensate).
*$%pass: Maternal folic acid deficiency may prevent complete closure of the neural tube, resulting in spina bifida, in which parts of the nervous system are exposed to the outside world or covered with a thin membrane, or anencephaly, in which the brain fails to develop. However, like teratogens, maternal health issues can have variable effects on the developing embryo or fetus. Spina bifida may be so severe as to result in profound disability, or may be completely asymptomatic and only detected by a tuft of hair overlying the area. Overall, trends and associations can certainly be found between various environmental conditions and genes during development; however, outcomes are somewhat unpredictable and highly MCAT Concept Check 3.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1.

In this section, we take a more specific look at the biochemical properties of these developmental mechanisms, as well as a few An adult human being is composed of approximately 37 trillion cells.
*$%pass: These cells are organized into tissues that form organs within organ systems. In order to create an organism as complex as a human being, each cell must perform a specialized function. In addition, the cells in an organ must be organized such that the organ can function properly. For example, the pancreas must create both digestive enzymes (trypsin, carboxypeptidases A and B, pancreatic lipase, and others) and endocrine hormones (insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin). The cells that synthesize digestive enzymes must be located where cell products can enter ducts to ultimately empty into the duodenum. Likewise, the cells that synthesize endocrine hormones must be located near a blood vessel to put their products into systemic circulation. In order to accomplish this the cell must go through three stages: specification, determination, and differentiation. The initial stage of cell specialization is specification, in which the cell is reversibly designated as a specific cell type. This is followed by determination, which was previously defined as the commitment of a cell to a particular function in the future. Prior to determination the cell can become any cell type, even if it has already gone through specification. After determination the cell is irreversibly committed to a specific lineage. There are multiple pathways by which determination may occur. During cleavage, where the existing mRNA and protein in the parent cell has been asymmetrically distributed between the daughter cells, the presence of specific mRNA and protein molecules may result in determination. Determination may also occur due to secretion of specific molecules from nearby cells. These molecules, also called morphogens, may cause neighboring cells to follow a particular developmental pathway.
*$%pass: Determination is a commitment to a particular cell type, but note that the cell has not yet actually produced what it needs to carry out the functions of that cell type —that is the goal of differentiation. After a cell’s fate has been determined, the cell must begin to undertake changes that cause the cell to develop into the determined cell type. This includes changing the structure, function, and biochemistry of the cell to match the cell type, a process called differentiation. When a cell is determined, it is committed to a particular cell lineage. When the cell differentiates, it assumes the structure, function, and biochemistry of that cell Cells that have not yet differentiated or that give rise to other cells that will differentiate are known as stem cells. Stem cells exist in embryonic tissues as well as adult tissues. The tissues a particular stem cell can differentiate into are determined by its potency. Cells with the greatest potency are called totipotent and include embryonic stem cells; totipotent cells can differentiate into any cell type, either in the fetus or in placental structures. After the 16-cell stage, the cells of the morula begin to differentiate into two groups: the inner cell mass and the trophoblast. After a few more cycles of cell division these totipotent cells start to differentiate into the three germ cell layers. At this stage, the cells are said to be pluripotent; these cells can differentiate into any cell type except for those found in the placental structures. Finally, as the cells continue to become more specialized they are said to be multipotent stem cells, which can differentiate into multiple types of cells within a particular group.
*$%pass: For example, hematopoietic stem cells are capable of differentiating into all of the cells found in blood, including the various types of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets— but not into skin cells, neurons, or muscle cells. While we use all of these different terms to describe potency, it is important to recognize that potency is a spectrum—not a series of strict definitions. Also, note that stem cells exist not only in embryos, but also in adults, who have stem cells that give rise to skin, blood, and the epithelial lining of the digestive tract, among others. Stem cells are able to differentiate into different cell types. The potency of the stem cell determines how many different cell types a stem cell can become. As cells become more differentiated, the potency of the cell decreases (from totipotent to pluripotent to multipotent). Over the last few decades, stem cell research has been a hotly contested issue. While harvesting of embryonic stem cells, highlighted in Figure 3.8, ultimately results in termination of the embryo, it is thought that these cells could be used to regenerate human tissues, including the spinal cord (following injury) and the heart (following a heart attack). There are also immunologic concerns, as transplantation of stem cells of a different genetic makeup could evoke an immune response, resulting in rejection. In addition, once implanted, pluripotent cells may not necessarily differentiate into the desired tissue and may even structure of blastocyst with three cell types of inner cell mass labeled; colonies of ES cells Figure 3.8 Embryonic Stem Cells Stem cells are a cornerstone of biotechnology. Gene studies can be performed by introducing altered embryonic stem cells that contain transgenes into mice. Stem cells lacking a particular gene can be used to create knockout mice.
*$%pass: These processes are discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. In order to address this controversy, many researchers have begun investigating adult stem cells. At best, these cells are multipotent, able to differentiate into only a few different cell types. Researchers may take adult stem cells and use various transcription factors to increase potency in these cells. One of the potential advantages of this approach is that a stem cell can be taken from a patient (usually from blood, bone marrow, or adipose tissue), induced to become a different tissue type, and then implanted into that same patient. This offers reduced risk of rejection of foreign tissue. However, it is challenging to induce differentiation into the correct cell type, and most organs have a complex structure that depends on a number of different cell types, each of which requires different signals. Research is ongoing and holds promise, despite limited success. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking The role of microRNA-29b in controlling the differentiation of neuroectoderm cells into neural tube epithelial cells (NTE) and neural crest cells (NCC) remains unclear. To study the impact of microRNA-29b, researchers engineered microRNA sponges to contain multiple tandem binding sites for the target microRNA to competitively bind with microRNA-29b. In addition to the sponge, researchers also engineered microRNA- 29b-overexpressed cells by inserting a microRNA-29b sequence into the embryonic stem cell genome. Both are driven by a CAG promoter and inserted into the ROSA26 site. clarify the role It sounds like will “pick up” 29b that is both have the Figure 1 Neural tube epithelial cells differentiation experiment results.

Mir-29b mediates the neural tube versus neural crest fate decision during embryonic stem cell neural differentiation. Stem Cell Reports, 9(2), 571–586. How does microRNA-29b influence the differentiation of neuroectoderm cells into neural epithelial cells and neural crest cells, respectively? This question asks us to draw conclusions based on the data provided. To start, we’ll want to define the terms in the question stem and make sure we’re clear on exactly what we’re being asked for. We are told in the first paragraph that the neuroectoderm cells will differentiate into two types of cells, the neural epithelial cells and the neural crest cells. We are also told that microRNA-29b influences this process, but we do not know how it impacts differentiation. Now we must parse out how the target microRNA are being manipulated to see how those changes alter the neuroectoderm cells’ differentiation. The researchers created two experimental conditions, the microRNA sponge and the microRNA overexpression. Recall that microRNA works by binding to complementary sites on mRNA, which blocks translation mechanisms and prevents the synthesis of the gene product. As stated in the passage, the microRNA sponge has several sites that are complementary to the microRNA, which will act like a sponge by grabbing all the microRNA in the cell.
*$%pass: As a result, the microRNA will bind to the sponge instead of just binding to local RNA, meaning that there is functionally less microRNA-29b binding to the RNA as compared to normal. In other words, it is the opposite of the overexpressed condition. Now that we know what our action is (differentiation) and what the two conditions are (overexpression and inhibition), we can analyze the data. Figure 1 shows the neural epithelial cell results. In the microRNA sponge condition, the differentiation level is reduced compared to control, while in the microRNA overexpression condition the differentiation level is increased. This implies that microRNA-29b is critical for the differentiation of neuroectoderm cells to neural Looking at Figure 2, we see opposing effects. In the microRNA sponge condition, differentiation into neural crest cells is increased compared to control. In the microRNA overexpression condition, differentiation to neural crest cells is reduced. From these data, we can infer that microRNA suppresses neuroectoderm cell differentiation to neural crest cells. In conclusion, the presence of microRNA-29b is important for neuroectoderm cell differentiation into neural epithelial cells, but the presence of microRNA-29b suppresses differentiation into neural crest cells. The determination and differentiation of a cell depends on the location of the cell as well as the identity of the surrounding cells. The developing cell receives signals from organizing cells around it and may also secrete its own signaling molecules. As discussed previously, surrounding tissues induce a developing cell to become a particular cell type via inducers; the term inducer may also refer to the cell secreting the signal. The cell that is induced is called a responder (responsive cell); to be induced, a responder must be competent, or able to respond to the inducing signal. Cell–cell communication can occur via autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, or endocrine signals.
*$%pass: Autocrine signals act on the same cell that secreted the signal in the first place. Paracrine signals act on cells in the local area. Juxtacrine signals do not usually involve diffusion, but involve a cell directly stimulating receptors of an adjacent cell. Finally, endocrine signals involve secreted hormones that travel through the bloodstream to a distant target tissue. Inducers are often growth factors, which are peptides that promote differentiation and mitosis in certain tissues. Most growth factors only function on specific cell types or in certain areas, as determined by the competence of these cells. In this way, certain growth factors can code for particular tissues. For example, PAX6 is expressed in the ectoderm of the head, but in no other location. Therefore, as the optic vesicle approaches the overlying ectoderm producing this factor, development of the lens of the eye is induced. Interestingly, induction is not always a one-way pathway. To that end, differentiation of the lens then triggers the optic vesicle to form the optic cup, which ultimately becomes the retina. This is known as reciprocal development. Most tissues will be exposed to multiple inducers during the course of development. In development of the eyes, lateral outpocketings from the brain (optic vesicles) grow out and touch the overlying ectoderm. The optic vesicle induces the ectoderm to form the lens placode. The lens placode in turn induces the optic vesicle to create the optic cup. The optic cup then induces the lens placode to develop into the cornea and lens. Experiments with frog embryos show that if this ectoderm is subsequently transplanted to the trunk (after the optic vesicles have grown out), a lens will develop in the trunk. If, however, the ectoderm is transplanted before the outgrowth of the optic vesicles, it will not.
*$%pass: One of the main methods of signaling occurs via the use of gradients. Morphogens, or molecules that cause determination of cells, diffuse throughout the organism. Locations closer to the origin of the morphogen will be exposed to higher concentrations, while areas further away will have less combinations of morphogen exposure throughout the organism, which can thereby induce the differentiation of specific cell types. Some common morphogens include transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), sonic hedgehog (Shh), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Cell Migration, Cell Death, and Regeneration Induction and differentiation lead to the creation of different types of cells; however, these cells are not always in the right location to carry out their function. Further, the sculpting of various anatomic structures requires not only differentiation, but also the death of some cells. Certain organs also have the ability to recreate injured or surgically removed portions of tissue. Cells must be able to disconnect from adjacent structures and migrate to their correct location. For example, the anterior pituitary gland originates from a segment of oral ectoderm and must migrate from the top of the mouth to its final location just below the hypothalamus. Neural crest cells also undergo extensive migration. These cells form at the edge of the neural folds during neurulation and then migrate throughout the body to form many different structures including the sensory ganglia, autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and Schwann cells, as well as specific cell types in other tissues such as calcitonin-producing cells of the thyroid, melanocytes in the skin, and others. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurs at various times in development. For example, the fingers are originally webbed during development of the hand. The cells of the webbing later undergo apoptosis, resulting in separation of each individual finger and toe.
*$%pass: Apoptosis may occur via apoptotic signals or During the process of apoptosis the cell undergoes changes in morphology and divides into many self-contained protrusions called apoptotic blebs, which can then be broken apart into apoptotic bodies and digested by other cells, as shown in Figure 3.9. This allows recycling of materials. Because the blebs are contained by a membrane, this also prevents the release of potentially harmful substances into the extracellular environment. This is different from necrosis, which is a process of cell death in which a cell dies as a result of injury. In necrosis, internal substances can be leaked, causing irritation of nearby tissues or even an immune cell darkens, becomes smaller, and disintegrates into small vesicles Figure 3.9 Apoptosis An apoptotic cell disintegrates so that it can be absorbed and digested by other cells. Regenerative capacity, or the ability of an organism to regrow certain parts of the body, varies from species to species. Some species, such as salamanders and newts, have an enhanced capacity to regenerate because they retain extensive clusters of stem cells within their bodies. When regeneration is required, these stem cells can then migrate to the appropriate part of the body to initiate regrowth. These species are said to undergo complete regeneration, in that the lost or damaged tissues are replaced with identical tissues. In contrast, incomplete regeneration implies that the newly formed tissue is not identical in structure or function to the tissue that has been injured or lost. Humans typically exhibit incomplete regeneration in response to injury. However, in humans regenerative capacity varies by the tissue type. Liver tissue has a high regenerative capacity, often able to undergo extensive regeneration following injury or loss.
*$%pass: For example, living donors are often able to donate up to 50 percent of their liver tissue because their own livers will regenerate the missing portion. Unfortunately, the heart has little, if any, regenerative capacity, and scarring often results following an injury due to an event such as a heart attack. The kidneys have moderate regenerative capacity and are able to repair nephrons after injury to the tubules; however this regenerative capacity is easily overwhelmed, and kidney failure may result. Senescence and Aging As organisms age, changes occur in both molecular and cellular structure. This results in disruption of metabolism and, eventually, death of the organism. Senescence, or biological aging, can occur at the cellular and organismal level as these changes accumulate. At the cellular level, senescence results in the failure of cells to divide, normally after approximately 50 divisions in vitro. Research has demonstrated that this may be due to shortened telomeres, or the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres reduce the loss of genetic information from the ends of chromosomes and help prevent the DNA from unraveling—their high concentration of guanine and cytosine enables telomeres to “knot off” the end of the chromosome. Telomeres are difficult to replicate, however, so they shorten during each round of DNA synthesis. Eventually, the telomeres become too short, and the cell is no longer able to replicate. Some cells, including germ cells, fetal cells, and tumor cells, express an enzyme known as telomerase. This enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that is able to synthesize the ends of chromosomes, preventing senescence. Telomerase allows cells to divide indefinitely and may play a role in the survival of cancer cells. At the organismal level, senescence represents changes in the body’s ability to respond to a changing environment.
*$%pass: Aging is complex and often involves not only cellular senescence but also the accumulation of chemical and environmental damage over time.

What is the difference between apoptosis and necrosis? After Chapter 3.3, you will be able to: Recall the oxygenation status of blood in umbilical arteries and umbilical Identify the three fetal shunts, their locations, and the organs they bypass Recall that the placenta, shown in Figure 3.10, is the organ where nutrient, gas, and waste exchange occurs. It is crucial that maternal and fetal blood do not mix because they may be different blood types. The simplest method to move nutrients and waste products is by diffusion, the preferred method for water, glucose, amino acids, and inorganic salts. Diffusion requires a gradient, which implies there is a higher partial pressure of oxygen in maternal blood than in fetal blood. To further enhance the transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal circulation, fetal blood cells contain fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which has a greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (primarily HbA). This also assists with the transfer (and retention) of oxygen into the fetal circulatory system. Waste material and carbon dioxide move in the opposite direction. Figure 3.10 Placental Structure Although the embryo obtains its nutrients and oxygen from the person who is pregnant, there is no actual mixing of the blood. Instead, the placenta depends on the close proximity of the embryonic and maternal bloodstreams, facilitating diffusion between them.
*$%pass: Remember, gas exchange in the fetus occurs across the placenta. Fetal lungs do not function until birth. The placental barrier also serves another function: immunity. The fetus is immunologically naïve because it has not yet been exposed to any pathogens; however, accidental exposure can happen in utero. Thus, the crossing of antibodies across the placental membrane serves a protective function. The placenta also qualifies as an endocrine organ because it produces progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), all which are essential for Many pathogens are too large to cross the placental barrier by diffusion, but a set of pathogens called TORCHES infections can cross this barrier and cause significant birth defects. Therefore, screening for (and sometimes immunization against) these infections is recommended in pregnancy. TORCHES stands for TOxoplasma gondii, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, HErpes or HIV, and Syphilis. The umbilical vessels are commonly tested on the MCAT because they demonstrate the need to understand the proper biological definitions of artery and vein. Like all other arteries that carry blood away from the heart, the umbilical arteries carry blood away from the fetus toward the placenta. And, like all of the other veins that carry blood toward the heart, the umbilical vein carries blood toward the fetus from the placenta. Remember that oxygenation occurs at the placenta, rather than in the fetal lungs. Therefore, the umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood and the umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood. Unlike most other arteries, the umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products. Unlike most other veins, the umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood with nutrients. There are several key differences between fetal and adult circulation that demonstrate important characteristics of the developing organism. The lungs and liver both do not serve significant functions prior to birth.
*$%pass: Gas exchange does not occur at the lungs, but rather at the placenta. Detoxification and metabolism are primarily controlled by the mother’s liver, and nutrient and waste exchange occurs at the placenta as well. Thus, the fetus does not depend on its own lungs and liver. Notably, these two organs are both underdeveloped and sensitive to the high blood pressures they will receive in postnatal life; thus, the fetus constructs three shunts to actively direct blood away from these organs while they develop, as shown in Figure 3.11. Figure 3.11 Fetal Circulation (a) Systemic fetal circulation; (b) Enlarged view of fetal circulation highlighting the three fetal shunts Two different shunts are used to reroute blood from the lungs. The first, called the foramen ovale, is a one-way valve that connects the right atrium to the left atrium. This allows blood entering the right atrium from the inferior vena cava to flow into the left atrium instead of the right ventricle, and thereby be pumped through the aorta into systemic circulation directly. Unlike in adult circulation, the right side of the heart is at a higher pressure in the developing fetus than the left side, which pushes blood through the opening. After birth, this pressure differential reverses, shutting the foramen ovale. Second, the ductus arteriosus shunts leftover blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Again, the pressure differential between the right and left sides of the heart pushes blood through this opening and into systemic circulation. The liver is bypassed via the ductus venosus, which shunts blood returning from the placenta via the umbilical vein directly into the inferior vena cava.
*$%pass: The liver still receives some blood supply from smaller hepatic arteries in the systemic MCAT Concept Check 3.3 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What is the oxygenation status of the blood in the umbilical arteries? In the 2. What are the three fetal shunts? What vessels or heart chambers do they connect? What organ does each shunt bypass? Shunt Connected Vessels or Chambers Organ Bypassed 3.4Gestation and Birth After Chapter 3.4, you will be able to: Identify the major developmental features of each trimester Describe the three stages of birth Recall key concepts and terms used for the birth process, including parturition, prostaglandins, oxytocin, and afterbirth Human gestation lasts an estimated 280 days, which are divided into three trimesters. As a general rule, the larger the animal, the longer the gestational period and the fewer the offspring per pregnancy. For example, elephants usually have one calf and gestate for 22 months. In contrast, mice have 10 to 12 offspring per litter and gestate for only 20 days. Although you don’t need to know every detail of gestation for the MCAT, there are key developmental events in each trimester with which you should be familiar. The major organs begin to develop during the first few weeks. The heart begins to beat at approximately 22 days, and soon afterward the eyes, gonads, limbs, and liver start to form. By five weeks the embryo is 10 mm in length, and by week six it has grown to 15 mm. The cartilaginous skeleton begins to harden into bone by the seventh week. By the end of eight weeks most of the organs have formed, the brain is fairly developed, and the embryo becomes known as a fetus.
*$%pass: At the end of the third month the fetus is about 9 cm long. During the second trimester the fetus undergoes a tremendous amount of growth. It begins to move within the amniotic fluid, its face takes on a human appearance, and its toes and fingers elongate. By the end of the sixth month the fetus measures 30 to 36 cm long. The seventh and eighth months are characterized by continued rapid growth and further brain development. Antibodies are transported by highly selective active transport from the pregnant individual to the fetus for protection against foreign agents in preparation for life outside the womb; this transfer begins earlier in pregnancy, but is highest in the ninth month just before birth. The growth rate slows and the fetus becomes less active, as it has less room to move about. Advances in medicine have allowed premature babies born as early as 24 weeks to survive—far short of the normal 40 weeks. While these neonates may survive, there are often severe complications because fetal development is not complete at 24 weeks. These problems are most apparent in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Vaginal childbirth, or parturition, is accomplished by rhythmic contractions of uterine smooth muscle, coordinated by prostaglandins and the peptide hormone oxytocin. Birth consists of three basic phases. First, the cervix thins out and the amniotic sac ruptures, which is commonly called water breaking. Next, strong uterine contractions result in the birth of the fetus. Finally, the placenta and umbilical cord are expelled; these are often referred to as the afterbirth. MCAT Concept Check 3.4 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are some of the key developmental features of each trimester? 2. What occurs in each of the three phases of birth?
*$%pass: In this chapter, we have seen how a just-fertilized ovum (zygote) becomes an embryo. As organs develop and the body organizes into complex organ systems, that embryo will turn into a newborn baby. Development certainly does not stop there, however—humans nurture their young for years (sometimes decades!) as they undergo physical, cognitive, and sexual development. Embryonic development is extremely important because it lays the foundation for further development to proceed correctly. Most of the time, the process goes exactly as planned; however, this is not always the case. In medical school, you will study the wide spectrum of teratology—the study of birth defects. Adult structures that arise from embryonic germ layers are of special importance to us because they are commonly tested on the MCAT. For the remainder of embryology—from the first cleavage event to the last uterine contraction—focus on the main terminology and highlights of each stage, in addition to the differences between fetal and adult physiology. Now that we have seen from where the organ systems derive, we will begin our survey of anatomy and physiology. For the next eight chapters (Chapters 4 to 11 of MCAT Biology Review), we will explore the cells, tissues, organs, and interactions of each of the major organ systems. Our discussion begins with the nervous system. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Early Developmental Stages Fertilization is the joining of a sperm and an ovum. It usually occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The sperm uses acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the corona radiata and Once it contacts the oocyte’s plasma membrane, the sperm establishes the acrosomal apparatus and injects its pronucleus.
*$%pass: When the first sperm penetrates it causes a release of calcium ions, which prevents additional sperm from fertilizing the egg and increases the metabolic rate of the resulting diploid zygote. This is called the Fraternal (dizygotic) twins result from the fertilization of two eggs by two different sperm. Identical (monozygotic) twins result from the splitting of a zygote in two. Monozygotic twins can be classified by the placental structures they share (mono- vs. diamniotic, mono- vs. dichorionic). Cleavage refers to the early divisions of cells in the embryo. These mitotic divisions result in a larger number of smaller cells, as the overall volume does not change. The zygote becomes an embryo after the first cleavage because it is no Indeterminate cleavage results in cells that are capable of becoming any cell in the organism, while determinate cleavage results in cells that are committed to differentiating into a specific cell type. The morula is a solid mass of cells seen in early development. The blastula (blastocyst) has a fluid-filled center called a blastocoel and has two different structures: the trophoblast (which becomes placental structures) and the inner cell mass (which becomes the developing The blastula implants in the endometrial lining and forms the placenta. The chorion contains chorionic villi, which penetrate the endometrium and create the interface between maternal and fetal blood. Before the placenta is established, the embryo is supported by the yolk The allantois is involved in early fluid exchange between the embryo and the yolk sac. The amnion lies just inside the chorion and produces amniotic fluid. The developing organism is connected to the placenta via the umbilical During gastrulation, the archenteron is formed with a blastopore at the end. As the archenteron grows through the blastocoel it contacts the opposite side, establishing three primary germ layers.
*$%pass: The ectoderm becomes epidermis, hair, nails, and the epithelia of the nose, mouth, and anal canal, as well as the nervous system (including adrenal medulla) and lens of the eye. The mesoderm becomes much of the musculoskeletal, circulatory, and excretory systems. Mesoderm also gives rise to the gonads and the muscular and connective tissue layers of the digestive and respiratory systems, as well as the adrenal cortex. The endoderm becomes much of the epithelial linings of the respiratory and digestive tracts and parts of the pancreas, thyroid, bladder, and distal urinary tracts. Neurulation, or development of the nervous system, begins after the formation of the three germ layers. The notochord induces a group of overlying ectodermal cells to form neural folds surrounding a neural groove. The neural folds fuse to form the neural tube, which becomes the central nervous system. The tip of each neural fold contains neural crest cells, which become the peripheral nervous system (sensory ganglia, autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and Schwann cells), as well as specific cell types in other tissues (calcitonin-producing cells of the thyroid, melanocytes in the skin, and others). Teratogens are substances that interfere with development, causing defects or even death of the developing embryo. Teratogens include alcohol, certain prescription drugs, viruses, bacteria, and environmental chemicals. Maternal conditions can affect development, including diabetes (increased fetal size and hypoglycemia after birth) and folic acid deficiency (neural Mechanisms of Development Cell specialization occurs as a result of determination and differentiation. Determination is the commitment to a specific cell lineage, which may be accomplished by uneven segregation of cellular material during mitosis or with morphogens, which promote development down a specific cell line.
*$%pass: To respond to a specific morphogen, a cell must have Differentiation refers to the changes a cell undergoes due to selective transcription to take on characteristics appropriate to its cell line. Stem cells are cells that are capable of developing into various cell types. They can be classified by potency. Totipotent cells are able to differentiate into all cell types, including the three germ layers and placental structures. Pluripotent cells are able to differentiate into all three of the germ layers and their derivatives. Multipotent cells are able to differentiate only into a specific subset of Cells communicate through a number of different signaling methods. An inducer releases factors to promote the differentiation of a competent Autocrine signals act on the same cell that released the signal. Paracrine signals act on local cells. Juxtacrine signals act through direct stimulation of adjacent cells. Endocrine signals act on distant tissues after traveling through the These are often growth factors, which are peptides that promote differentiation and mitosis in certain tissues. If two tissues both induce further differentiation in each other, this is Signaling often occurs via gradients. Cells may need to migrate to arrive at their correct location. Apoptosis is programmed cell death via the formation of apoptotic blebs that can subsequently be absorbed and digested by other cells. Apoptosis can be used for sculpting certain anatomical structures, such as removing the webbing between digits. Regenerative capacity is the ability of an organism to regrow certain parts of the body. The liver has high regenerative capacity, while the heart has low Senescence is the result of multiple molecular and metabolic processes, most notably, the shortening of telomeres during cell division. Nutrient, gas, and waste exchange occurs at the placenta.
*$%pass: Oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged due to concentration Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (primarily HbA); this affinity assists in the transfer (and retention) of oxygen into the fetal circulatory system. The placental barrier also serves as immune protection against many pathogens, and antibodies are transferred from the pregnant individual to The placenta serves endocrine functions, secreting estrogen, progesterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta; the umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood from the placenta back to the fetus. The fetal circulatory system differs from its adult version by having three The foramen ovale connects the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs. The ductus arteriosus connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. The ductus venosus connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver. Gestation and Birth In the first trimester, organogenesis occurs (development of heart, eyes, gonads, limbs, liver, brain). In the second trimester, tremendous growth occurs, movement begins, the face becomes distinctly human, and the digits elongate. In the third trimester, rapid growth and brain development continue, and there is transfer of antibodies to the fetus. During birth the cervix thins out and the amniotic sac ruptures. Then, uterine contractions, coordinated by prostaglandins and oxytocin, result in birth of the fetus. Finally, the placenta and umbilical cord are expelled. Answers to Concept Checks 1.

The umbilical vein carries Connected Vessels or Chambers Right atrium to left atrium Ductus arteriosus Pulmonary artery to aorta Umbilical vein to inferior vena cava Liver 1. In the first trimester, organogenesis occurs (development of heart, eyes, gonads, limbs, liver, brain). In the second trimester, tremendous growth occurs, movement begins, the face becomes distinctly human, and the digits elongate. In the third trimester, rapid growth and brain development continue, and there is transfer of antibodies to the fetus. 2. In the first phase of birth, the cervix thins out and the amniotic sac ruptures. In the second phase, uterine contractions, coordinated by prostaglandins and oxytocin, result in birth of the fetus. In the third phase, the placenta and umbilical cord are expelled. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Prostaglandins promote cervical dilation and the onset of contractions, and oxytocin promotes uterine contractions in a positive feedback loop. Oxytocin is also involved in milk letdown and helps the uterus to contract (shrink) following delivery. These factors together lead to (D) as the right answer. By contrast, prolactin, which promotes milk production, is produced following childbirth, which eliminates (A), and progesterone maintains the pregnancy and actually inhibits uterine contractions, eliminating (B) and To answer this question, it could be useful to review quickly the embryonic layers. The ectoderm gives rise to the integument (the epidermis, hair, nails, and the epithelia of the nose, mouth, and anal canal), the lens of the eye, and the nervous system (including the adrenal medulla). The endoderm gives rise to the epithelial linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts and parts of the liver, pancreas, thyroid, and bladder.
*$%pass: Finally, the mesoderm gives rise to the musculoskeletal system, the circulatory system, the excretory system, the gonads, and the adrenal cortex. Therefore, the only correct association can be found in (C) because the fingernails are derived from ectoderm. A rod of mesodermal cells called the notochord develops along the longitudinal axis just under the dorsal layer of ectoderm. Through inductive effects from the notochord, the overlying ectoderm starts bending inward and forms a groove on the dorsal surface of the embryo. The dorsal ectoderm will eventually pinch off and develop into the spinal cord and brain. While the neural tube forms from ectoderm, the notochord itself is The influence of a specific group of cells on the differentiation of another group of cells is termed induction. For example, the eyes are formed through reciprocal induction between the brain and the ectoderm. Competence refers to the ability of a cell to respond to a given inducer, but not the influence of the group of organizing cells, eliminating (A). Senescence is a term for biological aging, eliminating (B). Determination may be the result of induction, but this term does not refer to the general concept of the effect of one group of cells on the differentiation of another group of cells, During pregnancy, the placenta produces estrogen and progesterone to maintain the endometrium. These hormones are necessary for proper gestation of the fetus and should be measurable in maternal blood because they act on maternal organs. Prior to birth, the fetus is immunologically naïve and does not yet produce immunoglobulins, eliminating (A). It is worth noting, though, that maternal immunoglobulins cross the placenta to enter fetal blood. Fetal hemoglobin is a large protein and, thus, cannot easily cross the placenta.
*$%pass: Further, red blood cells are much too large to cross the barrier themselves, eliminating (B). Carbon dioxide from fetal metabolism can be found in maternal blood, but the fetal lungs are nonfunctional prior to birth as the fetus is suspended in amniotic fluid. Carbon dioxide is transferred across the placenta directly from the fetal bloodstream, The question stem states that a cell releases a substance that diffuses through the environment and causes differentiation of a nearby cell. Because the cell is acting on a nearby cell and the molecule spreads by diffusion, this is an example of paracrine signaling. Autocrine signaling, (A), occurs when a molecule secreted by a cell acts on the same cell. Juxtacrine signaling, (B), occurs between adjacent cells, but the signal does not spread by diffusion. In endocrine signaling, (D), a molecule is secreted that travels via the bloodstream to a distant target. Cells that are able to divide indefinitely with no senescence are not exhibiting normal cell behavior. Normally, somatic cells divide a limited number of times until the telomeres become too short to be effective protectors of genomic material. When this occurs, the cells stop dividing. However, in this case, the cells have continued to divide indefinitely. It is likely that the enzyme telomerase has been activated, which allows for synthesis of telomeres to counteract shortening during DNA replication. Organogenesis primarily occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy; after 8 weeks of gestation, the brain is fairly developed and most of the organs have formed. The severity of anencephaly suggests a defect very early in fetal development, leading to (A) as the correct answer. The second and third trimesters are marked by significant growth and further development. Defects in these stages may cause structural abnormalities, but the absence of an organ is unlikely.
*$%pass: Embryonic stem cells are controversial because they require termination of an embryo to harvest, eliminating (B). Adult stem cells are significantly less controversial, but require treatment with various transcription factors in order to increase the level of potency, eliminating (C). Rejection is a concern when foreign cells are introduced into an individual; using one’s own stem cells should remove this risk, eliminating (D). Adult stem cells are not naturally pluripotent, unless pluripotency has been induced by strategic use of transcription factors. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. During development, programmed cell death occurs in multiple locations in order to ensure development of the correct adult structures. One of the places in which this occurs is between fingers and toes; another is the digestive tract, where a central lumen is formed. If apoptosis does not occur correctly in the digestive tract, an imperforate anus could result. Failure of determination or differentiation would likely result in the absence of anorectal structures altogether, eliminating (A) and (B). Failure of neurulation would lead to the absence of a nervous system and would not be compatible with life, eliminating (D). After an injury, healing occurs by some sort of regenerative process. In humans, some tissues, such as the liver, are capable of regenerating tissue with much the same function and structure as the original tissue. However, the heart is not capable of this sort of regeneration, often forming a fibrous scar in an area of injury. This is an example of incomplete regeneration, in which newly formed tissues are not identical in structure or function to the tissues that have been injured or lost. Here, the mutation affects the skin and the nervous system, both of which are derived from ectoderm.
*$%pass: The other germ tissue layers do not lead to skin or nervous system formation, eliminating (B) and (C). The notochord is not actually a primary germ tissue layer, and thus cannot be an answer to the question, eliminating (D). After the first cell divisions occur, the embryo consists of a solid ball of cells known as a morula. Then a hollow center forms, creating the blastula. Finally, as the cells begin to differentiate into the three germ layers, the embryo is considered a gastrula. (C) is therefore the correct answer. The question stem states that the woman was given the drug three days before the baby was born. It is important to remember that organogenesis occurs during the first trimester. The last structure to become fully functional is the lungs. Because the organs were already largely formed prior to the administration of the teratogenic drug, it is likely that there was no major effect on the development of most organs as a result of exposure to the teratogen, eliminating (A), (B), and (C). However, because lung tissues are so sensitive and because they mature so late, it is likely that the infant may have some respiratory distress at birth. Blood flow in the ductus arteriosus is from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The direction of flow is determined by the pressure differential between the right side of the heart (and pulmonary circulation) and the left side of the heart (and systemic circulation). Unlike in adults, the right side of the heart is at a higher pressure during prenatal life than the left side, so blood will shunt from the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation through both the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.

*$%pass: In the 1800s, English physicians who interacted with these indigenous South Americans recognized the possible uses of this paralytic agent, now known as tubocurarine, as an anesthetic agent for surgeries. Physicians noticed that animals under the influence of tubocurarine would become temporarily immobilized, but would recover after a period of paralysis. According to these physicians, this anesthetic agent would revolutionize surgery. To test the effectiveness of the new drug, one of the physicians volunteered to demonstrate its effectiveness by being tested for pain perception while under the influence of tubocurarine. While the drug was an effective paralyzing agent, it did not have any effect on the sensory receptors of the body—he felt every test without being able to move or express his Organisms sense pain, temperature, and all aspects of their environment through the nervous system, which also coordinates this sensory information and responds to stimuli. Specifically, the nervous system is responsible for the control of muscular movement, neuromuscular reflexes, and glandular secretions (such as salivation and lacrimation). In addition, the nervous system is responsible for higher-level thinking and mental function. Despite all of its complex functions, the nervous system operates through basic electrical and chemical signals. Biomedical scientists have discovered much about the nervous system: its anatomical and functional divisions, the nature of the action potential, and its histological features under the microscope. However, there is so much more that we do not know. It is an inspirational challenge for future physicians to realize that the brain continues to be a vast frontier for human exploration and discovery.
*$%pass: 4.1Cells of the Nervous System High-Yield After Chapter 4.1, you will be able to: Recall the different terms used for myelin-producing cells in the peripheral and the central nervous systems Identify the functions of the five main categories of glial cells Describe the purpose of each major structure of the neuron Neurons are specialized cells capable of transmitting electrical impulses and then translating those electrical impulses into chemical signals. In this section, we will consider the structure of the neuron as well as how neurons communicate with other parts of the nervous system. Each neuron has a shape that matches its function, as dictated by the other cells with which that neuron interacts. There are a variety of different types of neurons in the body, but they all share some specific features. Axons carry neural signals away from the soma; dendrites carry signals toward The anatomy of a neuron is shown in Figure 4.1. Like all other cells (besides mature red blood cells), neurons have nuclei. The nucleus is located in the cell body, also called the soma. The soma is also the location of the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. The cell has many appendages emanating directly from the soma called dendrites, which receive incoming messages from other cells. The information received from the dendrites is transmitted through the cell body before it reaches the axon hillock, which integrates the incoming signals. The axon hillock plays an important role in action potentials, or the transmission of electrical impulses down the axon. Signals arriving from the dendrites can be either excitatory or inhibitory; the axon hillock sums up these signals, and if the result is excitatory enough (reaching threshold, as discussed later in this chapter), it will initiate an action potential.
*$%pass: The axon is a long appendage that terminates in close proximity to a target structure (a muscle, a gland, or another neuron). Most mammalian nerve fibers are insulated by myelin, a fatty membrane, to prevent signal loss or crossing of signals. Just like insulation prevents wires next to each other from accidentally discharging each other, the myelin sheath maintains the electrical signal within one neuron. In addition, myelin increases the speed of conduction in the axon. Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. At certain intervals along the axon, there are small breaks in the myelin sheath with exposed areas of axon membrane called nodes of Ranvier. As will be explored in the discussion of action potentials to follow, nodes of Ranvier are critical for rapid signal conduction. Finally, at the end of the axon is the nerve terminal or synaptic bouton (knob). This structure is enlarged and flattened to maximize transmission of the signal to the next neuron and ensure proper release of neurotransmitters, the chemicals that transmit (oligodendrocytes in CNS), nodes of Ranvier, myelin sheath, axon, nerve terminals Figure 4.1 Structure of a Neuron Sometimes the body mounts an immune response against its own myelin, leading to the destruction of this insulating substance (demyelination). Because myelin speeds the conduction of impulses along a neuron, the absence of myelin slows down information transfer. A common demyelinating disorder is multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, the myelin of the brain and spinal cord is selectively targeted. Because so many different kinds of neurons are demyelinated, patients who have MS experience a wide variety of symptoms including weakness, lack of balance, vision problems, and incontinence. Neurons are not physically connected to each other.
*$%pass: Between the neurons, there is a small space into which the terminal portion of the axon releases neurotransmitters, which bind to the dendrites of the adjacent neuron (the postsynaptic neuron). This space is known as the synaptic cleft; together, the nerve terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic membrane are known as a synapse. Neurotransmitters released from the axon terminal traverse the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Multiple neurons may be bundled together to form a nerve in the peripheral nervous system. These nerves may be sensory, motor, or mixed, which refers to the type(s) of information they carry; mixed nerves carry both sensory and motor information. The cell bodies of neurons of the same type are clustered together In the central nervous system, axons may be bundled together to form tracts. Unlike nerves, tracts only carry one type of information. The cell bodies of neurons in the same tract are grouped into nuclei. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in exon 1 of IT15, which encodes for the protein huntingtin. Although huntingtin is widely expressed, HD is associated with the neurodegeneration of the striatal medium spiny neurons. This particular vulnerability is hypothesized to result from transcriptional dysregulation within the cAMP and CREB signaling cascades in these neurons. Thus, a potential treatment would be to target phosphodiesterases (PDE) that inactivate cAMP and CREB cascades. To test this hypothesis, and the potential therapeutic approach, researchers investigated whether administration of TP-10, a highly specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor would alleviate neurological deficits in a highly utilized HD model system, the R6/2 mouse.
*$%pass: Loss of reflexes, loss of body weight, and increased instances of clasping behavior in the mice were monitored in the TP-10 intervention group and the vehicle control group. Righting reflex is assessed by laying the mice on their side and monitoring their ability to get back to the upright position. Clasping is a behavior correlated to within cAMP and CREB leads to = they want to Model system for HD = these mice Behavior on these axons covered with extensions from oligodendrocyte, with loose association to an astrocyte loses reflex at a Trend: wild-type (WT) gain weight toward the end of the experiment; R6/2 Trend: vehicle group develops “clasping” before treatment Adapted from: Giampà, C., Laurenti, D., Anzilotti, S., Bernardi, G., Menniti, F. S., & Fusco, F. R. (2010). Inhibition of the striatal specific phosphodiesterase PDE10a ameliorates striatal and cortical pathology in R6/2 mouse model of Does TP-10 treatment alleviate neurological deficits associated with This question asks about the results of the associated study, so we are going to have to use the information in the article and the results in the figures in order to answer. The article says that TP-10 is a possible treatment for Huntington’s disease (HD), and the second paragraph describes the dependent variables used to measure success in this experiment. There appears to be a figure associated with each dependent variable, so we will need to evaluate the results in each figure to reach a conclusion. Based on the label and axes of the graph, Figure 1A shows the age at which mice lose their righting reflex. Specifically, we can see that that R6/2 TP-10 (red) retains their righting reflex longer than R6/2 Vehicle (black).
*$%pass: According to the passage, the loss of the righting reflex indicates neurodegeneration; therefore, TP-10 appears to be alleviating this particular symptom. However, Figure 1B shows that mice who had the HD genetic condition lost weight in both treatment and vehicle conditions, meaning TP-10 doesn’t appear to have helped with weight maintenance. Finally, Figure 1C shows that clasping occurs more readily in R6/2 Vehicle than R6/2 TP-10. The term clasping alone doesn’t imply positive or negative effects on the brain, but the article tells us that clasping is a sign of neurodegeneration. Thus, the data showing that R6/2 TP-10-treated mice have later onset of clasping demonstrates that neurological deficits are being Overall, Figures 1A and 1C indicate that TP-10 may have potential to treat neurological deficits associated with Huntington’s disease. Figure 1B, however, indicates that this treatment may not be addressing all aspects of the disease. Other Cells in the Nervous System Neurons are not the only cells in the nervous system. Neurons must be supported and myelinated by other cells. These cells are often called glial cells, or neuroglia. Glial cells play both structural and supportive roles, as shown in Figure 4.2 Glial Cells: Astrocytes and Oligodendrocytes A detailed knowledge of these cell types is not necessary for the MCAT, so a familiarity with their basic functions will suffice: Astrocytes nourish neurons and form the blood–brain barrier, which controls the transmission of solutes from the bloodstream into nervous Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and produce cerebrospinal fluid, which physically supports the brain and serves as a shock absorber. Microglia are phagocytic cells that ingest and break down waste products and pathogens in the central nervous system.

The Action Potential Neurons use all-or-nothing messages called action potentials to relay electrical impulses down the axon to the synaptic bouton. As we will explore in the following section, action potentials ultimately cause the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. A cell’s resting membrane potential is the net electric potential difference that exists across the cell membrane, created by movement of charged molecules across that membrane.
*$%pass: For neurons, this potential is about 70 mV, with the inside of the neuron being negative relative to the outside. The two most important ions involved in generating and maintaining the resting potential are potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+). The potassium concentration inside the cell averages about 140 mM, as compared to 4 mM outside of the cell. This concentration difference makes it favorable for potassium to move to the outside of the cell. To facilitate the outward movement of potassium, the cell membrane has transmembrane potassium leak channels, which allow the slow leak of potassium out of the cell. As potassium continually leaks out of the cell, the cell loses a small amount of positive charge, leaving behind a small amount of negative charge and making the outside of the cell slightly positively charged. However, as negative charge builds up inside the cell, some potassium will be drawn back into the cell due to the attraction between the positive potassium ions and the negative potential building inside the cell. As the potential difference continues to grow, potassium will also be more strongly drawn back into the cell. And at a certain potential, each potassium cation that is pushed out due to the concentration gradient will be matched by another potassium cation pulled back in due to the electric potential. At this point, there is no more net movement of the ion, as the cell is in equilibrium with respect to potassium. The potential difference that represents this potassium equilibrium is called the equilibrium potential of potassium. Potassium’s equilibrium potential is around -90 mV. The negative sign is assigned due to convention, and because a positive ion (potassium) is leaving the cell.
*$%pass: Even though we may think of these influxes and effluxes as big events, only a very small amount of potassium needs to exit the cell before the resulting electrostatic force equals the force of the concentration gradient. In fact, during an action potential the change to potassium’s intracellular concentration is so small that it cannot even be accurately measured using current devices! The action potential is reliant only on local voltage changes at the membrane itself, so this overall lack of change in intracellular ion concentration does not impact transmission. This is the reason why you see membrane potentials reported in units of voltage, which are easily measurable, instead of concentration change, which is almost negligible. Because so little potassium needs to exit, the equilibrium potential with respect to potassium is established almost instantly. Next, let’s consider in isolation the other important ion, sodium. Sodium’s concentration gradient is the reverse of potassium’s, with a concentration of about 12 mM inside and 145 mM outside of the cell, meaning there is a driving force pushing sodium into the cell. This movement is facilitated by sodium leak channels. The slow leak of sodium into the cell causes a buildup of electric potential. The equilibrium potential of sodium is around 60 mV, and is positive because sodium is moving into the cell. In a living system, sodium and potassium are flowing across the cell’s membrane at the same time. Potassium’s concentration gradient causes potassium to leak out of the cell through potassium leak channels. At the same time, sodium is moving in the opposite direction, with the opposite effect. In a certain sense, sodium undoes the effect of potassium’s movement.
*$%pass: The resting potential is thus a tug-of- war: Potassium’s movement pulls the cell potential toward 90 mV, while sodium’s movement pulls the cell potential the opposite way, toward +60 mV. But neither ion ever “wins” the tug-of-war. Instead, a balance of these two effects is reached at around 70 mV for the average nerve cell, as can be seen in Figure 4.3. This balance, the net effect of sodium’s and potassium’s equilibrium potentials, is the resting membrane potential. The resting potential is significantly closer to potassium’s equilibrium potential because the cell is much more permeable to potassium. Neither ion is ever able to establish its own equilibrium, so both ions continue leaking across the cell membrane. sodium/potassium pump moving 3 sodium ions out and 2 potassium ions in while hydrolyzing ATP; passive sodium and potassium leak Figure 4.3 Maintenance of Resting Membrane Potential The action of Na+/K+ ATPase, Na+ leak channels, and K+ leak channels creates and maintains a resting membrane potential of 70 mV. The resting membrane potential is dependent on the intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, relative permeability Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz voltage equation brings together these different factors into one equation that predicts the resting membrane potential. This equation is discussed in Chapter 8 of MCAT Given the continual ion leaking at the membrane, there must be a means of moving both sodium and potassium ions back against their gradients if a resting potential is to be maintained. Na+/K+ ATPase continually pumps sodium and potassium back to where they started: potassium into the cell and sodium out of the cell, to maintain their respective gradients. In fact, in a person’s body more ATP is spent by the Na+/K+ ATPase to maintain these gradients than for any other single purpose.
*$%pass: To remember the direction of ion movement by Na+/K+ ATPase, think pumpKin. The Axon Hillock Neurons can receive both excitatory and inhibitory input. Excitatory input causes depolarization (raising the membrane potential, Vm, from its resting potential) and thus makes the neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Inhibitory input causes hyperpolarization (lowering the membrane potential from its resting potential) and thus makes the neuron less likely to fire an action potential. If the axon hillock receives enough excitatory input to be depolarized to the threshold value (usually in the range of 55 mV to 40 mV), an action potential will be This implies that not every stimulus necessarily generates a response. A small excitatory signal may not be sufficient to bring the axon hillock to threshold. Further, a postsynaptic neuron may receive information from several different presynaptic neurons, some of which are excitatory and some of which are inhibitory. The additive effect of multiple signals is known as summation. There are two types of summation: temporal and spatial. In temporal summation, multiple signals are integrated during a relatively short period of time. A number of small excitatory signals firing at nearly the same moment could bring a postsynaptic cell to threshold, enabling an action potential. In spatial summation, the additive effects are based on the number and location of the incoming signals. A large number of inhibitory signals firing directly on the soma will cause more profound hyperpolarization of the axon hillock than the depolarization caused by a few excitatory signals firing on the dendrites of a Ion Channels and Membrane Potential A graph of membrane potential vs.
*$%pass: time during an action potential is shown in graph starts at -70 mV, increases during Na+ influx to +35, drops durnig K+ efflux to below -70 mV (hyperpolarization), brought back to -70 mV by Na/K pump; threshold shown at -50 mV Figure 4.4 Action Potential Generation Sufficient depolarization across the cell membrane to threshold leads to the generation of an action potential, followed by repolarization and hyperpolarization before returning to the resting membrane potential. If the cell is brought to threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels open in the membrane. As the name implies, these ion channels open in response to the change in potential of the membrane (depolarization) and permit the passage of sodium ions. There is a strong electrochemical gradient that promotes the migration of sodium into the cell. From an electrical standpoint, the interior of the cell is more negative than the exterior of the cell, which favors the movement of positively charged sodium cations into the cell. From a chemical standpoint, there is a higher concentration of sodium outside the cell than inside, which also favors the movement of sodium into the cell. As sodium passes through these ion channels, the membrane potential becomes more positive; that is, the cell rapidly depolarizes. Sodium channels not only open in response to changes in membrane potential, but are also inactivated by them. When Vm approaches +35 mV, the sodium channels are inactivated and will have to be brought back near the resting potential to be deinactivated. Thus, these sodium channels can exist in three states: closed (before the cell reaches threshold, and after inactivation has been reversed), open (from threshold to approximately +35 mV), and inactive (from approximately +35 mV to the resting potential).
*$%pass: Na+ wants to go into the cell because the cell is more negative inside (electrical gradient) and has a lower concentration of Na+ inside (chemical gradient). The positive potential inside the cell not only triggers the voltage-gated sodium channels to inactivate, but also triggers the voltage-gated potassium channels to open. Once sodium has depolarized the cell, there is an electrochemical gradient favoring the efflux of potassium from the neuron. As positively charged potassium cations are driven out of the cell, there will be a restoration of the negative membrane potential called repolarization. The efflux of K+ causes an overshoot of the resting membrane potential, hyperpolarizing the neuron. This hyperpolarization serves an important function: it makes the neuron refractory to further action potentials. There are two types of refractory periods. During the absolute refractory period, no amount of stimulation can cause another action potential to occur. During the relative refractory period, there must be greater than normal stimulation to cause an action potential because the membrane is starting from a potential that is more negative than its resting value. Action potentials rely on both electrical and chemical gradients. The neuron starts at the resting potential, around –70 mV. At the resting potential, potassium is high inside the cell and low outside the cell, while sodium is high outside the cell and low inside the cell. Once the cell reaches threshold, sodium channels open and sodium floods the cell, making it more positive inside (depolarization). Then, sodium channels are inactivated and the potassium channels open. This allows potassium to flow out of the cell, bringing the potential into the negative range (repolarization), and actually overshooting the resting potential (hyperpolarization). Na+/K+ ATPase then works to restore the resting potential.
*$%pass: The Na+/K+ ATPase acts to restore not only the resting potential, but also the sodium and potassium gradients that have been partially dissipated by the action So far, we have discussed the movements of ions at one small segment of the axon. For a signal to be conveyed to another neuron, the action potential must travel down the axon and initiate neurotransmitter release. This movement is called impulse propagation and is shown in Figure 4.5. As sodium rushes into one segment of the axon, it will cause depolarization in the surrounding regions of the axon. This depolarization will bring subsequent segments of the axon to threshold, opening the sodium channels in those segments. Each of these segments then continues through the rest of the action potential in a wave-like fashion until the action potential reaches the nerve terminal. After the action potential has fired in one segment of the axon, that segment becomes momentarily refractory, as described previously. The functional consequence of this is that information can only flow in one direction. action potential moving left to right, followed closely behind by a refractory segment of the axon Figure 4.5 Action Potential Propagation Action potentials are propagated down the axon when proximal sodium channels open and depolarize the membrane, inducing distal sodium channels to open as well; because of the refractory character of these channels, the action potential can move in only one direction. A toxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX) is found in the pufferfish, a delicacy in some parts of the world. TTX blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels, blocking neuronal transmission. This can rapidly cause death because the phrenic nerves innervating the diaphragm can no longer depolarize, leading to paralysis of the muscle and cessation of breathing. For this reason, chefs who prepare pufferfish must be specially trained and licensed.
*$%pass: Local anesthetics work by blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels. These drugs work particularly well on sensory neurons and therefore block the transmission of pain. They favor pain neurons because these neurons have small axonal diameters and little or no myelin, allowing easy access to the sodium channels. Anesthetic concentrations are kept sufficiently low to block pain neurons without significant effects on other sensory modalities or motor function. The speed at which action potentials move depends on the length and cross- sectional area of the axon. Increased length of the axon results in higher resistance and slower conduction. Greater cross-sectional areas allow for faster propagation due to decreased resistance. The effect of cross-sectional area is more significant than the effect of length. In order to maximize the speed of transmission, mammals have myelin. Myelin is an extraordinarily good insulator, preventing the dissipation of the electric signal. The insulation is so effective that the membrane is only permeable to ion movement at the nodes of Ranvier. Thus, the signal “hops” from node to node—what is called saltatory conduction. Saltatory conduction can be recalled by thinking of the Spanish verb saltar, to It is important to note that all action potentials within the same type of neuron have the same potential difference during depolarization. Increased intensity of a stimulus does not result in an increased potential difference of the action potential, but rather an increased frequency of firing. Insulation by myelin is extremely effective. A human spinal cord is about the thickness of a finger. Without this insulation, the cord would have to be almost as wide as a telephone pole to prevent signal loss. As discussed previously, neurons are not actually in direct physical contact.
*$%pass: There is a small space between neurons called the synaptic cleft into which neurotransmitters are secreted, as shown in Figure 4.6. To clarify the terminology, the neuron preceding the synaptic cleft is called the presynaptic neuron; the neuron after the synaptic cleft is called the postsynaptic neuron. If a neuron signals to a gland or muscle, rather than another neuron, the postsynaptic cell is termed an effector. Most synapses are chemical in nature; they use small molecules referred to as neurotransmitters to send messages from one cell to action potential causing synaptic vesicle to fuse with terminal membrane, diffusing neurotransmitter across cleft to receptors on dendrite of postsynaptic cell Figure 4.6 The Synapse Synaptic vesicles are released from the presynaptic neuron and diffuse across the synaptic cleft to activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron (or gland or muscle). Prior to release, neurotransmitter molecules are stored in membrane-bound vesicles in the nerve terminal. When the action potential reaches the nerve terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium to flow into the cell. This sudden increase in intracellular calcium triggers fusion of the membrane-bound vesicles with the cell membrane at the synapse, causing exocytosis of the neurotransmitter. It is critical to understand the difference between electrical and chemical transmission. Within a neuron, electricity is used to pass signals down the length of the axon. Between neurons, chemicals (neurotransmitters) are used to pass signals to the subsequent neuron (or gland or muscle). Once released into the synapse, the neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. This allows the message to be passed from one neuron to the next. As stated earlier, neurons may be either excitatory or inhibitory; this distinction truly comes at the level of the neurotransmitter receptors.
*$%pass: If the receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel, the postsynaptic cell will either be depolarized or hyperpolarized. If it is a G protein- coupled receptor, it will cause either changes in the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) or an influx of calcium. Note that the physiology of receptors is further discussed in Chapter 3 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. Neurotransmission must be regulated—there are almost no circumstances under which constant signaling to the postsynaptic cell would be desirable. Therefore, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft. There are three main mechanisms to accomplish this goal. First, neurotransmitters can be broken down by enzymatic reactions. The breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), shown in Figure 4.7, is a classic example. acetylcholine removed from acetylcholine receptor and broken down Figure 4.7 Breakdown of a Neurotransmitter by an Enzyme Acetylcholine (ACh) can be broken down by acetylcholinesterase Second, neurotransmitters can be brought back into the presynaptic neuron using reuptake carriers. The reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), shown in Figure 4.8, is a classic example of this mechanism. Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) also use reuptake carriers. serotonin released into synapse, acts on postsynaptic receptor as well as “stop production” receptor on presynaptic cell, reuptake transporter brings serotonin back into cell Figure 4.8 Reuptake of a Neurotransmitter Serotonin (5-HT) can be taken back up by the presynaptic cell; an autoreceptor will signal the presynaptic cell to stop releasing serotonin and start the reuptake Many common drugs modify processes that occur in the synapse. For instance, cocaine acts by blocking neuronal reuptake carriers, thus prolonging the action of neurotransmitters in the synapse. There are clinically useful drugs (some of which are used to treat Alzheimer’s disease, glaucoma, and myasthenia gravis) that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, thereby elevating synaptic levels of acetylcholine.
*$%pass: Nerve gases, which have been used in warfare and terrorism, are extremely potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Nerve gas causes rapid death by preventing the relaxation of skeletal muscle (most importantly, the diaphragm), leading to respiratory arrest. Third, neurotransmitters may simply diffuse out of the synaptic cleft. Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous signaling molecule, fits into this category.

Functions of the nervous system include: Sensation and perception Cognition (thinking) and problem solving Executive function and planning Language comprehension and creation Emotion and emotional expression Balance and coordination Regulation of endocrine organs Regulation of heart rate, breathing rate, vascular resistance, temperature, and The human nervous system is a complex web of over 100 billion cells that communicate, coordinate, and regulate signals for the rest of the body. Action occurs when the body can react to external stimuli using the nervous system. In this section, we will look at the nervous system and its basic organization. Note: Much of the information contained in this section is also discussed in Chapter 1 of MCAT Behavioral Sciences Review. Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems Generally speaking, there are three kinds of nerve cells in the nervous system: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons (also known as afferent neurons) transmit sensory information from sensory receptors to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons (also known as efferent neurons) transmit motor information from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands. Interneurons are found between other neurons and are the most numerous of the three types.
*$%pass: Interneurons are located predominantly in the brain and spinal cord and are often linked to reflexive behavior. Afferent neurons ascend in the spinal cord toward the brain; efferent neurons exit the spinal cord on their way to the rest of the body. Different types of information require different types of processing. Processing of stimuli and response generation may happen at the level of the spinal cord, or may require input from the brainstem or cerebral cortex. Reflexes, discussed later in this section, only require processing at the level of the spinal cord. For example, when a reflex hammer hits the patellar tendon, the sensory information goes to the spinal cord, where a motor signal is sent to the quadriceps muscles, causing the leg to jerk forward at the knee. No input from the brain is required. However, some scenarios require input from the brain or brainstem. When this happens, supraspinal circuits are used. Let’s turn to the overall structure of the human nervous system, which is diagrammed in Figure 4.9. flowchart; organization and descriptions given in subsequent text Figure 4.9 Major Divisions of the Nervous System The nervous system can be broadly divided into two primary components: the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The brain consists of white matter and grey matter. The white matter consists of axons encased in myelin sheaths. The grey matter consists of unmyelinated cell bodies and dendrites. In the brain, the white matter lies deeper than the grey matter. At the base of the brain is the brainstem, which is largely responsible for basic life functions such as breathing. Note that the lobes of the brain and major brain structures are discussed in Chapter 1 of MCAT Behavioral Sciences Review.
*$%pass: The spinal cord extends downward from the brainstem and can be divided into four regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. Almost all of the structures below the neck receive sensory and motor innervation from the spinal cord. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column, which transmits nerves at the space between adjacent vertebrae. Like the brain, the spinal cord also consists of white and grey matter. The white matter lies on the outside of the cord, and the grey matter is deep within it. The axons of motor and sensory neurons are in the spinal cord. The sensory neurons bring information in from the periphery and enter on the dorsal (back) side of the spinal cord. The cell bodies of these sensory neurons are found in the dorsal root ganglia. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord ventrally, or on the side closest to the front of the body. The structure of the spinal cord can be seen in Figure 4.10. Figure 4.10 The Spinal Cord Sensory neurons transmit information about pain, temperature, and vibration up to the brain and have cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia toward the back of the spinal cord; the motor neurons run from the brain along the opposite side of the spinal cord and in the ventral root to control movements of skeletal muscle and glandular secretions. The peripheral nervous system (PNS), in contrast, is made up of nerve tissue and fibers outside the brain and spinal cord, including all 31 pairs of spinal nerves and 10 of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves (the olfactory and optic nerves are technically outgrowths of the central nervous system). The PNS thus connects the CNS to the rest of the body and can itself be subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.
*$%pass: The somatic nervous system consists of sensory and motor neurons distributed throughout the skin, joints, and muscles. Sensory neurons transmit information through afferent fibers. Motor impulses, in contrast, travel along efferent fibers. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) generally regulates heartbeat, respiration, digestion, and glandular secretions. In other words, the ANS manages the involuntary muscles associated with many internal organs and glands. The ANS also helps regulate body temperature by activating sweating or piloerection, depending on whether we are too hot or too cold, respectively. The main thing to understand about these functions is that they are automatic, or independent of conscious control. Note the similarity between the words autonomic and automatic. This association makes it easy to remember that the autonomic nervous system manages automatic functions such as heartbeat, respiration, digestion, and temperature control. One primary difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems is that the peripheral component of the autonomic nervous system contains two neurons. By contrast, a motor neuron in the somatic nervous system goes directly from the spinal cord to the muscle without synapsing. In the autonomic nervous system, two neurons work in series to transmit messages from the spinal cord. The first neuron is known as the preganglionic neuron, whereas the second is the postganglionic neuron. The soma of the preganglionic neuron is in the CNS, and its axon travels to a ganglion in the PNS. Here it synapses on the cell body of the postganglionic neuron, which then stimulates the target tissue. The Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two subdivisions: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These two branches often act in opposition to one another, meaning that they are antagonistic.
*$%pass: For example, the sympathetic nervous system acts to accelerate heart rate and inhibit digestion, while the parasympathetic nervous system decelerates heart rate and promotes digestion. The first neuron in the autonomic nervous system is called the preganglionic neuron. The second neuron is the postganglionic neuron. The main role of the parasympathetic nervous system is to conserve energy. It is associated with resting and sleeping states and acts to reduce heart rate and constrict the bronchi. The parasympathetic nervous system is also responsible for managing digestion by increasing peristalsis and exocrine secretions. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for parasympathetic responses in the body and is released by both preganglionic and postganglionic neurons. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for much of the parasympathetic innervation of the thoracic and abdominal cavity. The functions of the parasympathetic nervous system are summarized in Figure 4.11. Figure 4.11 Functions of the Parasympathetic Nervous System In contrast, the sympathetic nervous system is activated by stress. This can include everything from a mild stressor, such as keeping up with school or work deadlines, to emergencies that mean the difference between life and death. The sympathetic nervous system is closely associated with rage and fear reactions, also known as “fight-or-flight” reactions. When activated, the sympathetic nervous system: Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems: Increases heart rate Redistributes blood to muscles of locomotion Increases blood glucose concentration Relaxes the bronchi Decreases digestion and peristalsis Dilates the eyes to maximize light intake Releases epinephrine into the bloodstream The functions of the sympathetic nervous system are summarized in Figure 4.12. In the sympathetic nervous system, preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine, while most postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine. Figure 4.12 Functions of the Sympathetic Nervous System Neural circuits called reflex arcs control reflexive behavior.
*$%pass: For example, consider what occurs when someone steps on a nail. Receptors in the foot detect pain, and the pain signal is transmitted by sensory neurons up to the spinal cord. At that point, the sensory neurons connect with interneurons, which can then relay pain impulses up to the brain. Rather than wait for the brain to send out a signal, interneurons in the spinal cord can also send signals to the muscles of both legs directly, causing the individual to withdraw the foot with pain while supporting with the other foot. The original sensory information still makes its way up to the brain; however, by the time it arrives there, the muscles have already responded to the pain, thanks to the reflex arc. There are two types of reflex arcs: monosynaptic and polysynaptic. Consider the purpose of reflexes. Although it may be amusing to watch your leg jump when a doctor tests your knee-jerk reflex, there is a more functional reason why this response occurs. The stretch on the patellar tendon makes the body think that the muscle may be getting overstretched. In response, the muscle contracts in order to prevent injury. In a monosynaptic reflex arc, there is a single synapse between the sensory neuron that receives the stimulus and the motor neuron that responds to it. A classic example is the knee-jerk reflex, shown in Figure 4.13. When the patellar tendon is stretched, information travels up the sensory (afferent, presynaptic) neuron to the spinal cord, where it interfaces with the motor (efferent, postsynaptic) neuron that causes contraction of the quadriceps muscles. The net result is extension of the leg, which lessens the tension on the patellar tendon. Note that the reflex is simply a feedback loop and a response to potential injury.
*$%pass: If the patellar tendon or quadriceps muscles are stretched too far, they may tear, damaging the knee joint. Thus, the reflex serves to protect the muscles. Figure 4.13 The Knee-Jerk Reflex The knee-jerk or knee extension reflex may be elicited by swiftly stretching the patellar tendon with a In a polysynaptic reflex arc, there is at least one interneuron between the sensory and motor neurons. A real-life example is the reaction to stepping on a nail described earlier, which involves the withdrawal reflex. The extremity with which one steps on the nail will be stimulated to flex, using the hip muscles and hamstring muscles, pulling the foot away from the nail. This is a monosynaptic reflex, similar to the knee-jerk reflex described previously. However, if the person is to maintain balance, the other foot must be planted firmly on the ground. For this to occur, the motor neuron that controls the quadriceps muscles in the opposite limb must be stimulated, extending it. Interneurons in the spinal cord provide the connections from the incoming sensory information to the motor neurons in the supporting limb.

*$%pass: It is the seat of personality and, ultimately, the system that makes you you. In medical school, your courses on neuroscience will go into astounding detail about the nervous system, including the circuits that govern sensations such as pain and temperature, and circuits that allow your body to move and function. In this chapter, we explored the nervous system at both the cellular and organizational level. Neurons are the primary cells of the nervous system, propagating impulses through both electrical and chemical means—action potentials and synaptic transmission, respectively. Neurons can be grouped together to form nerves, which are the primary organizational structures in one major branch of the nervous system, the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system can be subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, the latter of which can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The nervous system is heavily tested on the MCAT because it plays a role in the function of almost every other major organ system. Neurons cause muscles to move and digestive structures to carry food along through peristalsis, and they regulate breathing rate, heart rate, and glandular secretions. The nervous system is not the only system that has such a profound effect throughout the body, however.
*$%pass: The endocrine system, which we will explore in the next chapter, serves a similar role—but through chemical messengers carried in the blood called You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Cells of the Nervous System Neurons are highly specialized cells responsible for the conduction of Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical forms of Electrical communication occurs via ion exchange and the generation of membrane potentials down the length of the axon. Chemical communication occurs via neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell and the binding of these neurotransmitters to the Neurons consist of many different parts. Dendrites are appendages that receive signals from other cells. The cell body or soma is the location of the nucleus as well as organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. The axon hillock is where the cell body transitions to the axon, and where action potentials are initiated. The axon is a long appendage down which an action potential travels. The nerve terminal or synaptic bouton is the end of the axon from which neurotransmitters are released. Nodes of Ranvier are exposed areas of myelinated axons that permit The synapse consists of the nerve terminal of the presynaptic neuron, the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, and the space between the two, called the synaptic cleft. Many axons are coated in myelin, an insulating substance that prevents Myelin is created by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Myelin prevents dissipation of the neural impulse and crossing of neural impulses from adjacent neurons. Individual axons are bundled into nerves or tracts. A single nerve may carry multiple types of information, including sensory, motor, or both. Tracts contain only one type of information.
*$%pass: Cell bodies of neurons of the same type within a nerve cluster together in ganglia in the peripheral nervous system. Cell bodies of the individual neurons within a tract cluster together in nuclei in the central nervous system. Neuroglia or glial cells are other cells within the nervous system in addition Astrocytes nourish neurons and form the blood–brain barrier, which controls the transmission of solutes from the bloodstream into nervous Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and produce cerebrospinal fluid, which physically supports the brain and serves as a Microglia are phagocytic cells that ingest and break down waste products and pathogens in the central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes (CNS) and Schwann cells (PNS) produce myelin Transmission of Neural Impulses All neurons exhibit a resting membrane potential of approximately 70 Resting potential is maintained using selective permeability of ions as well as the Na+/K+ ATPase. The Na+/K+ ATPase pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in. Incoming signals can be either excitatory or inhibitory. Excitatory signals cause depolarization of the neuron. Inhibitory signals cause hyperpolarization of the neuron. Temporal summation refers to the integration of multiple signals near each other in time. Spatial summation refers to the addition of multiple signals near each other in space. An action potential is used to propagate signals down the axon. When enough excitatory stimulation occurs, the cell is depolarized to the threshold voltage and voltage-gated sodium channels open. Sodium flows into the neuron due to its strong electrochemical gradient. This continues depolarizing the neuron. At the peak of the action potential (approximately +35 mV), sodium channels are inactivated and potassium channels open. Potassium flows out of the neuron due to its strong electrochemical gradient, repolarizing the cell.
*$%pass: Potassium channels stay open long enough to overshoot the resting potential, resulting in a hyperpolarized neuron; then, the potassium channels close. The Na+/K+ ATPase brings the neuron back to the resting potential and restores the sodium and potassium gradients. While the axon is hyperpolarized, it is in its refractory period. During the absolute refractory period, the cell is unable to fire another action potential. During the relative refractory period, the cell requires a larger than normal stimulus to fire an action potential. The impulse propagates down the length of the axon because the influx of sodium in one segment of the axon brings the subsequent segment of the axon to threshold. The fact that the preceding segment of the axon is in its refractory period means that the action potential can only travel in one direction. At the nerve terminal, neurotransmitters are released into the synapse. When the action potential arrives at the nerve terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open. The influx of calcium causes fusion of vesicles filled with neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, which may be ligand-gated ion channels or G protein-coupled receptors. Neurotransmitters must be cleared from the postsynaptic receptors to stop the propagation of the signal. There are three ways this can happen: The neurotransmitter can be enzymatically broken down. The neurotransmitter can be absorbed back into the presynaptic cell by The neurotransmitter can diffuse out of the synaptic cleft. Organization of the Human Nervous System There are three types of neurons in the nervous system: motor (efferent) neurons, interneurons, and sensory (afferent) neurons.
*$%pass: The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (PNS: cranial and spinal In the CNS, white matter consists of myelinated axons, and grey matter consists of unmyelinated cell bodies and dendrites. In the brain, white matter is deeper than grey matter. In the spinal cord, grey matter is deeper than white matter. The PNS is divided into the somatic (voluntary) and autonomic (automatic) nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) and sympathetic (fight-or-flight) Reflex arcs use the ability of interneurons in the spinal cord to relay information to the source of a stimulus while simultaneously routing it to the In a monosynaptic reflex arc, the sensory (afferent, presynaptic) neuron fires directly onto the motor (efferent, postsynaptic) neuron. In a polysynaptic reflex arc, the sensory neuron may fire onto a motor neuron as well as interneurons that fire onto other motor neurons. Answers to Concept Checks 1. The axon transmits an electrical signal (the action potential) from the soma to the synaptic knob. The axon hillock integrates excitatory and inhibitory signals from the dendrites and fires an action potential if the excitatory signals are strong enough to reach threshold. Dendrites receive incoming signals and carry them to the soma. The myelin sheath acts as insulation around the axon and speeds conduction. The soma is the cell body and contains the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. The synaptic bouton lies at the end of the axon and releases neurotransmitters. 2. A collection of cell bodies in the central nervous system is called a nucleus. In the peripheral nervous system, it is called a ganglion. 3. Astrocytes nourish neurons and form the blood–brain barrier, which helps protect the brain from foreign pathogens gaining entrance.
*$%pass: Microglia ingest and break down waste products and pathogens. Disruption of either of these mechanisms would increase susceptibility to a CNS infection. 4. Oligodendrocytes produce myelin in the central nervous system while Schwann cells produce myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Since GBS causes demyelination in the PNS, it can be inferred that Schwann cells are targeted for immune destruction. 1. The action potential is initiated at the axon hillock. 2. The resting membrane potential is maintained by the Na+/K+ATPase at approximately 70 mV. 3. Temporal summation is the integration of multiple signals close to each other in time. Spatial summation is the integration of multiple signals close to each other in space. 4. The sodium channel opens first at threshold (around 50 mV). It is regulated by inactivation, which occurs around +35 mV. Inactivation can only be reversed by repolarizing the cell. The opening of the sodium channel causes 5. The potassium channel opens second at approximately +35 mV. It is regulated by closing at low potentials (slightly below 70 mV). The opening of the potassium channel causes repolarization and, eventually, 6. During the absolute refractory period, the cell is unable to fire an action potential regardless of the intensity of a stimulus. During the relative refractory period, the cell can fire an action potential only with a stimulus that is stronger than normal. 7. Calcium is responsible for fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles with the nerve 8. A neurotransmitter’s action can be stopped by enzymatic degradation, reuptake, or diffusion. 1. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system includes cranial and spinal nerves and sensory 2. Afferent (sensory) neurons bring signals from a sensor to the central nervous system. Efferent (motor) neurons bring signals from the central nervous system to an effector. 3.
*$%pass: The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary actions—most notably, moving muscles. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for involuntary processes like heart rate, bronchial dilation, dilation of the pupils, exocrine gland function, and peristalsis. 4. The sympathetic nervous system promotes a “fight-or-flight” response, with increased heart rate and bronchial dilation, redistribution of blood to locomotor muscles, dilation of the pupils, and slowing of digestive and urinary function. The parasympathetic nervous system promotes “rest-and- digest” functions, slowing heart rate and constricting the bronchi, redistributing blood to the gut, promoting exocrine secretions, constricting the pupils, and promoting peristalsis and urinary function. 5. In a monosynaptic reflex, a sensory (afferent, presynaptic) neuron fires directly onto a motor (efferent, postsynaptic) neuron. In a polysynaptic reflex, a sensory neuron may fire directly onto a motor neuron, but interneurons are used as well. These interneurons fire onto other motor Science Mastery Assessment Explanations The polarization of the neuron at rest is the result of an uneven distribution of ions between the inside and outside of the cell. This difference is achieved through the active pumping of ions into and out of the neuron (using the Na+/K+ ATPase). Voltage-gated calcium channels are important in the nerve terminal, where the influx of calcium triggers the fusion of vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the membrane, but not in maintaining resting membrane potential. Myelin is a white lipid-containing material surrounding the axons of many neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is arranged on the axon discontinuously; the gaps between the segments of myelin are called nodes of Ranvier, eliminating (B). Myelin increases the conduction velocity by insulating segments of the axon so that the membrane is permeable to ions only at the nodes of Ranvier, eliminating (A).
*$%pass: The action potential jumps from node to node, a process known as saltatory conduction, eliminating (D). Action potentials are often described as being “all-or- nothing”; the magnitude of the potential difference of an action potential is fixed, regardless of the intensity of the stimulus. Thus, myelin does not affect the magnitude of the potential difference in an action potential, making (C) the correct answer. As in the previous question, the action potential is often described as an all- or-nothing response. This means that, whenever the threshold membrane potential is reached, an action potential with a consistent size and duration is produced. Neuronal information is coded by the frequency and number of action potentials, not the size of the action potential, eliminating (B) and (C) and making (D) the correct answer. Hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) signals are not transmitted to the nerve terminal, eliminating (A). Nerves are collections of neurons in the peripheral nervous system and may contain multiple types of information (sensory or motor); they contain cell bodies in ganglia. Tracts are collections of neurons in the central nervous system and contain only one type of information; they contain cell bodies in Sensory neurons are considered afferent (carrying signals from the periphery to the central nervous system) and enter the spinal cord on the dorsal side. Motor neurons are considered efferent (carrying signals from the central nervous system to the periphery) and exit the spinal cord on the ventral side. When a sensory neuron receives a signal that is strong enough to bring it to threshold, one can assume that the receptor becomes depolarized, allowing it to transduce the stimulus to an action potential. The action potential will then be carried by sensory neurons to the central nervous system, where the cell will release neurotransmitters.
*$%pass: Therefore, among the given choices, the only incorrect statement is found in (C). If a receptor is stimulated, it will promote the spread of the action potential to postsynaptic sensory neurons in the spinal cord, which can send the signal toward the brain. When the potential across the axon membrane is more negative than the normal resting potential, the neuron is referred to as hyperpolarized. Hyperpolarization occurs right after an action potential and is caused by excess potassium exiting the neuron. The somatic division of the peripheral nervous system innervates skeletal muscles and is responsible for voluntary movement. Some of the pathways in this part of the nervous system are reflex arcs, which are reflexive responses to certain stimuli that involve only a sensory and a motor neuron. These neurons synapse in the spinal cord and do not require signaling from the brain. The pathways of the somatic division can involve two, three, or more neurons, depending on the type of signal. The correct answer therefore The parasympathetic nervous system governs the “rest-and-digest” response. The parasympathetic nervous system slows the heart rate, decreases blood pressure, promotes bloodflow to the GI tract, and constricts the pupils, among other functions. The sympathetic nervous system governs the fight- or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, decreased bloodflow to the digestive tract, and increased bloodflow to the muscles. (D) is the only answer choice that represents a function of the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by the preganglionic neuron in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The postganglionic neuron in the sympathetic nervous system usually releases norepinephrine, while the postganglionic neuron in the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine. Neurons contain very specialized structures, including dendrites, axons, and the axon hillock.
*$%pass: However, neurons are still cells and must carry out cellular functions including protein synthesis. The cell body or soma contains the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. First, consider the function of voltage-gated calcium channels. When the nerve terminal depolarizes, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing for influx of calcium. This influx of calcium triggers fusion of the synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the membrane of the neuron at the nerve terminal. This allows for exocytosis of the neurotransmitters into the synapse. If a disease blocked the influx of calcium, there would be no release of neurotransmitters. A lack of neurotransmitters means that the neuron cannot send excitatory signals. Thus, any symptoms resulting from this disease would be due to an inability of neurons to transmit excitatory signals to the muscle. If neurons cannot communicate, flaccid paralysis may be one of the results. Some neurons require multiple instances of excitatory transmission to be brought to threshold. These excitatory signals may be close to each other in time (temporal) or in space (spatial); either way, this pattern of excitation is Schwann cells are responsible for myelination of cells in the peripheral nervous system. Thus, the central nervous system is unlikely to be affected. The peripheral nervous system includes the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is composed of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Thus, (A) is the The dorsal root ganglion contains cell bodies of sensory neurons only. If a dorsal root ganglion is disrupted at a certain level, there will be a loss of sensation at that level. Furthermore, reflexes rely on sensory afferents that are part of the dorsal root ganglion. As a result, reflex arcs will also be GO ONLINE Consult your online resources for additional practice.

In order to work eﬀectively, fuel resources must be conserved or used appropriately, such as when responding to stressful situations. In addition, organs must be able to communicate with the brain to cause changes in behavior and physiology to maintain homeostasis. As the messengers in the endocrine system, hormones play an essential role in this communication. For example, the pancreas produces insulin and glucagon. Insulin induces the transport of glucose into organs and the storage of excess glucose when blood glucose concentrations are high. Conversely, glucagon triggers the release of sugar stores which raises blood glucose concentration.
*$%pass: Working together, these hormones ensure that there are adequate levels of glucose for organ function, but that glucose levels are not so high as to cause damage to organ systems. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases in the United States and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing cells in the islets of Langerhans are destroyed. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is caused by end-organ insensitivity to insulin. In both cases, blood glucose concentrations rise to dangerous levels (sometimes up to ten times the normal concentration), which can cause signiﬁcant damage to organs, including the retina of the eye, the glomeruli of the kidneys, the coronary vessels of the heart and cerebral vessels of the brain, and peripheral nerves. Le untreated (or, to be frank, even if treated in many cases), diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, strokes, and limb amputations. Regardless of the ﬁeld you enter, you will spend a signiﬁcant amount of time working with diabetic patients and will have to think about the eﬀects of this disease on other conditions and their treatment. In this chapter, we will explore the diﬀerent types of hormones and how they work. We’ll survey the various endocrine organs and discuss the hormones each one produces. is is an extremely high-yield chapter: the MCAT frequently tests not only the makeup of the endocrine system (hormones and their functions), but also the processes of the endocrine system (feedback loops and their regulation).

*$%pass: steroid hormones Recall the process for synthesizing amino acid–derivative hormones Distinguish between direct and tropic hormones e endocrine system consists of organs, known as glands, that secrete hormones. Hormones are signaling molecules that are secreted directly into the bloodstream to distant target tissues At target tissues, hormones bind to receptors, inducing a change in gene expression or cellular functioning. Not all hormones share the same structure and function. In order to understand how each hormone functions, it is ﬁrst important to understand basic Classification of Hormones by Chemical Structure Hormones can be subdivided into categories based on diﬀerent criteria. First, hormones can be classiﬁed by their chemical identities. Hormones can be peptides, steroids, or amino acid derivatives. Peptide hormones are made up of amino acids, ranging in size from quite small (such as anti-diuretic hormone, ADH) to relatively large (such as insulin). Peptide hormones are all derived from larger precursor polypeptides that are cleaved during posttranslational modiﬁcation. ese smaller units are transported to the Golgi apparatus for further modiﬁcations that activate the hormones and direct them to the correct locations in the cell. Such hormones are released by exocytosis aer being packaged into vesicles. Because peptide hormones are charged and cannot pass through the plasma membrane, they must bind to an extracellular receptor. e peptide hormone is considered the ﬁrst messenger; it binds to the receptor and triggers the transmission of a second signal, known as the second messenger. ere are many diﬀerent receptor subtypes, and the type of receptor determines what happens once the hormone has stimulated the e connection between the hormone at the surface and the eﬀect brought about by second messengers within the cell is known as a signaling cascade. At each step, there is the possibility of ampliﬁcation.
*$%pass: For example, one hormone molecule may bind to multiple receptors before it is degraded. Also, each receptor may activate multiple enzymes, each of which will trigger the production of large quantities of second messengers. us, each step can result in an increase in signal intensity. Some common second messengers are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and calcium. e activation of a G protein–coupled receptor is shown in Figure 5.1. In this system, the binding of a peptide hormone triggers the receptor to either activate or inhibit an enzyme called adenylate cyclase, raising or lowering the levels of cAMP accordingly. cAMP can bind to intracellular targets, such as protein kinase A, which phosphorylates transcription factors like cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to exert the hormone’s ultimate eﬀect. Keep in mind that protein kinase A can modify other enzymes as well as transcription factors, and therefore it can have a rapid or slow eﬀect on the cell. Figure 5.1 Mechanism of Action of a Peptide Hormone Peptide hormones bind to membrane-bound receptors to intiate a signal cascade, using second messengers like e eﬀects of peptide hormones are usually rapid but short lived because these hormones act through second messenger cascades, which are transient. It is quicker to turn them on and oﬀ, compared with steroid hormones, but their eﬀects do not last without relatively constant Because peptides are generally water-soluble, peptide hormones can travel freely in the bloodstream and usually do not require carriers. is is in stark contrast to steroid hormones, which are lipid-soluble. Peptide hormones have surface receptors and act via second messenger systems. Steroid hormones bind to intracellular receptors and function by binding to DNA to alter gene Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and are produced primarily by the gonads and adrenal cortex.
*$%pass: Because steroid hormones are derived from nonpolar molecules, they can easily cross the cell membrane. Hence, their receptors are usually intracellular (in the cytosol) or intranuclear (in the nucleus). Upon binding to the receptor, steroid hormone–receptor complexes undergo conformational changes. e receptor can then bind directly to DNA, resulting in either increased or decreased transcription of particular genes, depending on the identity of the hormone, as shown in Figure 5.2. One common form of conformational change is dimerization, or pairing of two receptor–hormone complexes. e eﬀects of steroid hormones are slower but longer lived than peptide hormones because steroid hormones participate in gene regulation, causing alterations in the amount of mRNA and protein present in a cell by direct action on DNA. Figure 5.2 Mechanism of Action of a Steroid Hormone Estrogen, like all steroid hormones, influences cell behavior by modifying transcription. Steroid hormones are not water-soluble, so they must be carried by proteins in the bloodstream to travel around the body. Some of these proteins are very speciﬁc and carry only one hormone (such as sex hormone-binding globulin), while other proteins are nonspeciﬁc (such as albumin). Note that hormones are generally inactive while attached to a carrier protein and must dissociate from the carrier to function. erefore, levels of carrier proteins can change the levels of active hormone. For example, some conditions increase the quantity of a protein that carries thyroid hormones, thyroxine- binding globulin (TBG). is causes the body to perceive a lower level of thyroid hormone because the increased quantity of TBG binds a larger proportion of the hormone, meaning there is less free hormone available. Insulin is a peptide hormone, and it has to be released at every meal in order to be active. Thus, it has fast onset but is short-acting (like most peptide hormones).
*$%pass: Estrogen and testosterone are steroid hormones that promote sexual maturation. This is a slower, but longer-lasting change (as is true for most steroid hormones). Amino Acid–Derivative Hormones Finally, amino acid–derivative hormones are less common than peptide and steroid hormones, but include some of the most important hormones discussed in this chapter, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine. ese hormones are derived from one or two amino acids, usually with a few additional modiﬁcations. For example, thyroid hormones are made from tyrosine modiﬁed by the addition of several iodine atoms. e chemistry of this family of hormones is considerably less predictable and is one of the few instances where overt memorization may be the best strategy. For instance, the catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) bind to G protein–coupled receptors, while thyroid hormones bind intracellularly. During pregnancy, thyroxine-binding globulin. In order to compensate, people who are pregnant secrete much higher levels of the thyroid hormones. Thus, in order to diagnose thyroid disease during pregnancy, different reference values must be used. Classification of Hormones by Target Tissue Some hormones, known as direct hormones, are secreted and then act directly on a target tissue. For example, insulin released by the pancreas causes increased uptake of glucose by muscles. Other hormones, known as tropic hormones, require an intermediary to act. For example, as discussed in Chapter 2 of MCAT Biology Review, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH then acts on the gonads to stimulate testosterone production in males and estrogen production in females. GnRH and LH do not cause direct changes in the physiology of muscle, bone, and hair follicles; rather, they stimulate the production of another hormone by another endocrine gland that acts on these target tissues.
*$%pass: Tropic hormones usually originate in the brain and anterior pituitary gland, allowing for the coordination of multiple processes within the body. The mechanism of action of the amino acid–derivative hormones should be memorized because it is so unpredictable. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have extremely fast onset but are short-lived, like peptide hormones—think of an adrenaline rush. Thyroxine and triiodothyronine, on the other hand, have slower onset but a longer duration, like steroid hormones—they regulate metabolic rate over a long period of time. Most peptide and amino acid–derivative hormones have names that end in –in or –ine (insulin, vasopressin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and so on). Most steroid hormones have names that end in –one, –ol, or –oid (testosterone, aldosterone and other mineralocorticoids, cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and so on). is is not exhaustive, but may help you identify the chemistry of a hormone on Test Day.

*$%pass: Endocrine Organs and Hormones After Chapter 5.2, you will be able to: Recall the hormones involved in calcium homeostasis and their impact on blood Identify the tissue that synthesizes catecholamines and the major catecholamines List the pancreatic hormones, their regulators, and their impact on blood glucose Recall details about the hormones involved in water homeostasis, including their production, action, and ultimate impact on blood volume and osmolarity Recall the releasing hormones produced by the hypothalamus, their pituitary targets, and the end result of each signaling pathway on the final target organ: e hypothalamus, the pituitary, the thyroid, the parathyroid glands, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, the gonads (testes and ovaries), and the pineal gland are all endocrine glands, as shown in Figure 5.3. Each of these organs is capable of synthesizing and secreting one or more hormones. Furthermore, there are collections of cells within organs, such as the kidneys, gastrointestinal glands, heart, and thymus, that serve important endocrine roles. e organs in this second group are traditionally not called endocrine organs because hormone production is not their main function. Figure 5.3 Organs of the Endocrine System Endocrine organs produce hormones that are secreted into the bloodstream to act on distant target tissues. Now that we have discussed the mechanisms through which hormones act and their classiﬁcation, we can discuss the individual endocrine organs and the hormones secreted by each. Let’s begin with the hypothalamus, the bridge between the nervous and endocrine systems. By regulating the pituitary gland through tropic hormones, the hypothalamus is capable of having organism-wide eﬀects. e hypothalamus is located in the forebrain, directly above the pituitary gland and below the thalamus (hence the name hypothalamus).
*$%pass: Because the hypothalamus and the pituitary are close to each other, the hypothalamus controls the pituitary through paracrine release of hormones into a portal system that directly connects the two organs. e hypothalamus receives input from a wide variety of sources. For example, a part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus receives some of the light input from the retinae and helps to control sleep–wake cycles. Other parts of the hypothalamus respond to increases in blood osmolarity. Still other parts of the hypothalamus regulate appetite and satiety. The hypothalamus contains a number of nuclei in its three sections, called the lateral, ventromedial, and anterior hypothalamus. These nuclei play roles in emotional experience, aggressive behavior, sexual behavior, metabolism, temperature regulation, and water balance. The parts of the hypothalamus are discussed in Chapter 1 of MCAT Behavioral e release of hormones by the hypothalamus is regulated by negative feedback. Negative feedback occurs when a hormone (or product) later in the pathway inhibits hormones (or enzymes) earlier in the pathway. is type of feedback maintains homeostasis and conserves energy by restricting production of substances that are already present in suﬃcient quantities. e hypothalamus and pituitary gland are inextricably linked. e pituitary gland has an anterior and posterior component, each with a unique interaction with the hypothalamus. We will discuss each in turn. Interactions with the Anterior Pituitary e hypothalamus secretes compounds into the hypophyseal portal system, which is a blood vessel system that directly connects the hypothalamus with the anterior pituitary, as shown in Figure 5.4. us, hormones released from the hypothalamus travel directly to the anterior pituitary and cannot be found in appreciable concentrations in the systemic circulation. Note that hypophysis is an alternative term for the pituitary.
*$%pass: Once hormones have been released from the hypothalamus into this portal bloodstream, they travel down the pituitary stalk and bind to receptors in the anterior pituitary, stimulating the release of other hormones. Figure 5.4 The Hypophyseal Portal System A system of blood vessels connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary. e hypothalamus secretes several diﬀerent tropic hormones. e following indicates each hormone released by the hypothalamus and the hormone(s) released by the anterior pituitary in response: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) growth hormone yroid-releasing hormone (TRH) thyroid-stimulating hormone Corticotropin-releasing factor pattern—prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF), which is actually dopamine, is released by the hypothalamus and causes a decrease in prolactin secretion. Although it seems as if the anterior pituitary has all the power in the endocrine system, it is controlled by the hypothalamus, which is located directly above it. Whereas most of the hormones in the anterior pituitary require a factor from the hypothalamus to be released, prolactin is the exception. As long as the hypothalamus releases PIF (which is actually dopamine), no prolactin will be released. It is the absence of PIF that allows prolactin to be released. Each of the tropic hormones then causes the release of another hormone from an endocrine gland that has negative feedback eﬀects. For example, release of CRF from the hypothalamus will stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete ACTH. ACTH will then cause the adrenal cortex to increase the level of cortisol being secreted into the blood. However, cortisol is detrimental when levels become too high. To prevent excess cortisol secretion, cortisol inhibits the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary from releasing CRF and ACTH, respectively, as shown in Figure 5.5.
*$%pass: is makes sense because CRF and ACTH have already accomplished their desired eﬀect: getting more cortisol into the blood. What does this mean in terms of receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary? Cortisol receptors must be present in these organs; otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to recognize that cortisol levels had increased. ree-organ systems like these are commonly referred to as axes; for example, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis, and so on. Figure 5.5 Hypothalamic Negative Feedback Mechanism Interactions with the Posterior Pituitary e posterior pituitary does not receive tropic hormones through the hypophyseal portal system. Rather, neurons in the hypothalamus send their axons down the pituitary stalk directly into the posterior pituitary, which can then release oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions during labor, as well as milk letdown during lactation. ere is evidence that oxytocin is also involved in bonding behavior. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin) increases reabsorption of water in the collecting ducts of the kidneys. ADH is secreted in response to increased plasma osmolarity, or increased concentration of solutes within the blood. A tumor of the pituitary gland may result in compression of the portal system that connects the pituitary to the hypothalamus. This will block the ability of PIF to reach the pituitary and exert its effect. Thus, more prolactin will be released. This may result in lactation (galactorrhea), even in males. Thus, milk production in a male or nonpregnant female should lead a physician to suspect the presence of a pituitary tumor. As described earlier, the pituitary gland is divided into anterior and posterior sections. Because this distinction has already been covered, our discussion of the pituitary gland here will focus on the hormones released by e anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes seven diﬀerent products.
*$%pass: Four of these are tropic hormones, while the other three are direct We are going to mention the tropic hormones only brieﬂy here. ese hormones work by causing the release of another hormone at the organ level. us, we will discuss the tropic hormones in tandem with the endocrine organ on which they act. e release of both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. ese two hormones act on the gonads (testes and ovaries). e release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is stimulated by corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus; ACTH acts on the adrenal cortex. e release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is stimulated by thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus; TSH acts on the Products of the anterior pituitary: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Growth hormone (GH) Additionally, the four hormones in FLAT are all tropic hormones, while the three hormones in PEG are all direct hormones. Prolactin is more important in females than in males; it stimulates milk production in the mammary glands. Milk production in the male is always pathologic. During pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone levels are high. In addition, prolactin, a hormone that increases milk production, is also secreted by the anterior pituitary. Prolactin is an unusual hormone in that the release of dopamine from the hypothalamus decreases its secretion. e high levels of estrogen and progesterone allow for the development of milk ducts in preparation for lactation, but it is not until shortly aer the expulsion of the placenta, when estrogen, progesterone, and dopamine levels drop, that the block on milk production is removed and lactation actually Milk ejection occurs when the newborn infant latches on to the breast.
*$%pass: Nipple stimulation causes activation of the hypothalamus, resulting in two diﬀerent reactions. First, oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary, resulting in contraction of the smooth muscle of the breast and ejection of milk through the nipple. Second, the hypothalamus stops releasing dopamine onto the anterior pituitary, which allows prolactin release, causing production of milk and regulation of the milk supply. Endorphins decrease the perception of pain. For example, aer completing a marathon, many people will say they are on an endorphin “high” or “rush.” Endorphins mask the pain from having run 26.2 miles and can even induce a sense of euphoria. Many pharmaceutical agents, such as morphine, mimic the eﬀect of these naturally occurring painkillers. Growth hormone (GH) is named for exactly what it does: it promotes the growth of bone and muscle. is sort of growth is energetically expensive and requires large quantities of glucose. Growth hormone prevents glucose uptake in certain tissues (those that are not growing) and stimulates the breakdown of fatty acids. is increases the availability of glucose overall, allowing muscle and bone to use it. GH release is stimulated by growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus. Bone growth originates in special regions of the bone known as epiphyseal plates, which seal shut during puberty. An excess of GH released in childhood (before this closure) can cause gigantism, and a deﬁcit results in dwarﬁsm. In adults, the situation is slightly diﬀerent. Because the long bones are sealed, GH still has an eﬀect, but it is primarily in the smaller bones. e resulting medical condition is known as acromegaly. e bones most commonly aﬀected are those in the hands, feet, and head.
*$%pass: Patients with acromegaly tend to seek medical help because they have had to buy larger shoes, cannot wear their rings, and can no longer ﬁt into their hats. e posterior pituitary contains the nerve terminals of neurons with cell bodies in the hypothalamus. As mentioned earlier, the posterior pituitary receives and stores two hormones produced by the hypothalamus: ADH and ADH is secreted in response to low blood volume (as sensed by baroreceptors) or increased blood osmolarity (as sensed by osmoreceptors), shown in Figure 5.6. Its action is at the level of the collecting duct, where it increases the permeability of the duct to water. is increases the reabsorption of water from the ﬁltrate in the nephron. is results in greater retention of water, which results in increased blood volume and higher Figure 5.6 Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) The two hormones released from the posterior pituitary are actually synthesized in the hypothalamus and simply released from the posterior pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary does not synthesize any hormones itself. Oxytocin is secreted during childbirth and allows for coordinated contraction of uterine smooth muscle. Its secretion may also be stimulated by suckling, as it promotes milk ejection through contraction of smooth muscle in the breast. Finally, oxytocin may be involved in bonding behavior. Oxytocin is unusual in that it has a positive feedback loop: the release of oxytocin promotes uterine contraction, which promotes more oxytocin release, which promotes stronger uterine contractions, and so on. Positive feedback loops can usually be identiﬁed by a “spiraling forward” scheme and usually have a deﬁnitive endpoint—in this case, delivery. e thyroid is controlled by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary.
*$%pass: e thyroid is on the front surface of the trachea; it can be palpated (felt) as an organ near the base of the neck that moves up and down with swallowing. e thyroid has two major functions: setting basal metabolic rate and promoting calcium homeostasis. It mediates the ﬁrst eﬀect by releasing triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), while it carries out the second eﬀect through the release of calcitonin. Triiodothyronine and Thyroxine Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are both produced by the iodination of the amino acid tyrosine in the follicular cells of the thyroid. e numbers 3 and 4 refer to the number of iodine atoms attached to the tyrosine. yroid hormones are capable of resetting the basal metabolic rate of the body by making energy production more or less eﬃcient, as well as altering the utilization of glucose and fatty acids. Increased amounts of T3 and T4 will lead to increased cellular respiration. is leads to increased protein and fatty acid turnover by speeding up both synthesis and degradation of these compounds. High plasma levels of thyroid hormones will lead to decreased TSH and TRH synthesis; negative feedback prevents excessive secretion of T3 and T4, as shown in Figure 5.7. hypothalamus secretes TRH, stimulating anterior pituitary to secrete TSH, stimulating thyroid gland to release T3 and T4, which decrease TRH and TSH secretion Figure 5.7 Thyroid Hormone Negative Feedback A deﬁciency of iodine or inﬂammation of the thyroid may result in hypothyroidism, in which thyroid hormones are secreted in insuﬃcient amounts or not at all. e condition is characterized by lethargy, decreased body temperature, slowed respiratory and heart rate, cold intolerance, and weight gain. yroid hormones are required for appropriate neurological and physical development in children.
*$%pass: Most children are tested at birth for appropriate levels because a deﬁciency will result in intellectual disability and developmental delay (cretinism). An excess of thyroid hormone, which may result from a tumor or thyroid over-stimulation, is called hyperthyroidism. We can predict the clinical course of this syndrome by considering the opposite of each of the eﬀects seen in hypothyroidism: heightened activity level, increased body temperature, increased respiratory and heart rate, heat intolerance, and If we were to examine thyroid tissue under a light microscope, we would see two distinct cell populations within the gland. Follicular cells produce thyroid hormones and C-cells (also called parafollicular cells) produce calcitonin. Calcitonin decreases plasma calcium levels in three ways: by increasing calcium excretion from the kidneys, by decreasing calcium absorption from the gut, and by increasing storage of calcium in the bone. High levels of calcium in the blood stimulate secretion of calcitonin from Calcitonin tones down calcium levels in the blood. Calcium is an exceptionally important ion. The critically important functions of calcium Bone structure and strength Release of neurotransmitters from neurons Regulation of muscle contraction Clotting of blood (calcium is a cofactor) In addition, calcium also plays a role in cell movement and exocytosis of cellular materials. e parathyroids are four small pea-sized structures that sit on the posterior surface of the thyroid. e hormone produced by the parathyroid glands is aptly named parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH serves as an antagonistic hormone to calcitonin, raising blood calcium levels; speciﬁcally, it decreases excretion of calcium by the kidneys, increases absorption of calcium in the gut (via vitamin D), and increases bone resorption, thereby freeing up calcium, as shown in Figure 5.8. Like the hormones we have already seen, PTH is also subject to feedback inhibition.
*$%pass: As levels of plasma calcium rise, PTH secretion is decreased. Parathyroid hormone also promotes phosphorus homeostasis by increasing the resorption of phosphate from bone and reducing reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney (thus promoting its excretion in the urine). plasma calcium inhibits PTH; PTH increases calcium mobilization from bone, renal reabsorption, converstion of vitamin D to active form, and decreases renal phosphate reabsorption; vitamin D increases GI absorption of calcium and Figure 5.8 Calcium and Phosphorus Homeostasis PTH also activates vitamin D, which is required for the absorption of calcium and phosphate in the gut. e overall eﬀect of parathyroid hormone, therefore, is a signiﬁcant increase in blood calcium levels with little eﬀect on phosphate (the absorption of phosphate in the gut and its excretion in the kidney somewhat cancel each other). Just like glucagon and insulin, PTH and calcitonin are antagonistic to each other. We should think of these hormones as a pair with the primary function of regulating calcium levels in the blood. PTH increases serum calcium levels, whereas calcitonin decreases calcium Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Patients with mutations of the THRA (thyroid hormone receptor alpha) gene exhibit classical features of hypothyroidism. Researchers created a Topic: hypothyroidism; some outside knowledge of the mouse expressing a mutated TRα1 (denoted as PV; Thra1PV/+ mouse) that faithfully reproduces the classical hypothyroidism seen in patients. TRα1PV is a dominant negative mutant and cannot bind T3. Researchers then rendered Thra1PV/+ mice hypothyroidic by treating them with propylthiouracil (PTU). PTU is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism by inhibiting the enzyme thyroperoxidase. PTU-treated mice were then treated with T3 to induce symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Results are summarized in Figure 1.
*$%pass: These findings are consistent with earlier reports that the feedback loop in the pituitary-thyroid axis is not affected by expressing TRα1PV mutant in endocrine system might be Specific mutation of THRA cannot bind T3 and mice with mutation PTU: medicine to treat hyperthryoidism, used to induce hypothyroidism in these mice Findings are consistent with idea that the feedback loop is not Figure 1 Thyroid experiment results. Eu = IVs: Eu, Hypo, Hyper DVs: T3, T4, TSH Trends: Euthryoid means the thyroid is kept normal, so this is the control. The changes in T3, T4, and TSH are pretty consistent for each condition (Eu, Hypo, Hyper) between WT and PV/+ Adapted from Park, S., Han, C. R., Park, J. W., Zhao, L., Zhu, X., Willingham, M., … Cheng, S. Y. (2017). Defective erythropoiesis caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor α gene. PLoS Genetics, 13(9), e1006991. Why are TSH levels elevated in mice given propylthiouracil (PTU)? A question like this is asking us to explain the underlying biological cause for an observed phenomenon. e MCAT oen tests our ability to reason with a concept or mechanism that we are already familiar with. For this question, the stated change to the system is “propylthiouracil” and the eﬀect observed is “elevated TSH levels”. It is now our job to determine how the two are related. First, we’ll want to identify what information we’ll need, both from the passage and from our science background. MCAT questions will oen intentionally include terms that we aren’t familiar with. e key to answering these questions, even if we’re not familiar with the phenomenon described, is ﬁnding the relevant information from the passage and using that information in conjunction with our scientiﬁc understanding to solve the problem.
*$%pass: We already identiﬁed the change to the system in this question as the application of PTU. According to the passage, PTU is a medication that inhibits thyroperoxidase and it is used to treat hyperthyroidism. In the experiment, they used PTU to “render[ed] ra1PV/+ mice hypothyroidic”. If we look to Figure 1A, we can see that in the T3 and T4 graphs, the hypothyroid (gray) bar is signiﬁcantly smaller than the euthyroid (black) bar. If we weren’t sure what euthyroid referred to, we could infer that, given that the other two categories in each graph are hypothyroid and hyperthyroid, this must be wild-type or normal function. Based on these data and the context from the passage, it is reasonable to infer that PTU is a drug that functions by lowering the production of thyroid hormone (T3 and T4). Now we must consider how having low thyroid hormones would be related to elevated TSH levels. TSH is a tropic hormone released from the anterior pituitary, and it is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism involving thyroid hormone. Speciﬁcally, we should know that the hypothalamus releases thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), which causes the anterior pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH acts upon the thyroid to stimulate the release of thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 then act as negative feedback on the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, lowering TRH and TSH levels. We can reason that, if T3 and T4 levels were low, TRH and TSH would be continuously produced, as they would not be inhibited by the presence of T3 and e mice in the experiment have normally functioning endocrine glands prior to treatment.
*$%pass: We can always assume this to be the case unless the passage explicitly states otherwise: subjects should be assumed to be normal, healthy individuals with normal hormone levels. When PTU is administered, the thyroid hormone levels in the mice decreased. As a result, there is now less thyroid hormone in circulation. As we predicted, there is now little to no negative feedback on the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland. TRH and TSH levels in the mice would be elevated as a result of this lack of feedback. Normally, that would work to create more T3 and T4, but in this case, the mice are under the inﬂuence of PTU, and despite TSH stimulation, the thyroid will not be able to produce more T3 and T4. e cycle will continue, and more TRH and TSH will be In short, the reason why TSH level is elevated in mice administered with PTU is that there is no T3 or T4 to activate the negative feedback mechanism on TSH and TRH, which “tricks” the brain into secreting more TSH (and TRH). e adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys. Adrenal actually translates to near or next to the kidney. Each adrenal gland consists of a cortex and a medulla. is distinction is more than anatomical. Each part of the gland is responsible for the secretion of diﬀerent hormones. e adrenal cortex secretes corticosteroids. ese are steroid hormones that can be divided into three functional classes: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and cortical sex hormones. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that regulate glucose levels. In addition, these hormones also aﬀect protein metabolism. e two glucocorticoids most likely to be tested on the MCAT are cortisol and cortisone. ese hormones raise blood glucose by increasing gluconeogenesis and decreasing protein synthesis.
*$%pass: Cortisol and cortisone can also decrease inﬂammation and immunologic responses. Cortisol is known as a stress hormone because it is released in times of physical or emotional stress. is increases blood sugar and provides a ready source of fuel in case the body must react quickly to a dangerous stimulus. Many people who suffer from joint pain are treated with glucocorticoid injections into the joint space to decrease inflammation. In addition, glucocorticoids are used to treat systemic inflammation caused by allergic reactions or autoimmune disease. Glucocorticoid release is under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as described earlier. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus promotes release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior Mineralocorticoids are used in salt and water homeostasis; their most profound eﬀects are on the kidneys. e most noteworthy mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the nephron. Water follows the sodium cations into the bloodstream, increasing blood volume and pressure. Since water and sodium ions ﬂow together, plasma osmolarity remains unchanged; this is in contrast to ADH, which only increases water reabsorption (decreasing plasma osmolarity). Aldosterone also decreases the reabsorption of potassium and hydrogen ions in these same segments of the nephron, promoting their excretion in the urine. In addition to stimulating the secretion of aldosterone, which increases blood volume and hence blood pressure, angiotensin II also increases blood pressure directly through a powerful vasoconstrictive effect and increases heart rate. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, inhibiting vasoconstriction. Therefore, ACE inhibitors are frequently prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. In the latter case, vasodilation helps reduce vascular resistance, decreasing the pressure against which the failing heart must pump.
*$%pass: ACE inhibitors’ generic names end with –pril (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril). Unlike the glucocorticoids, aldosterone is primarily under the control of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, as shown in Figure 5.9. Decreased blood pressure causes the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney to secrete renin, which cleaves an inactive plasma protein, angiotensinogen, to its active form, angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs. Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Once blood pressure is restored, there is a decreased drive to stimulate renin release, thus serving as the negative feedback mechanism for this system. pathway ﬂowchart as described in previous paragraph Figure 5.9 The Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System Cortical Sex Hormones e adrenal glands also make cortical sex hormones (androgens and estrogens). Because the testes already secrete large quantities of androgens, adrenal testosterone plays a relatively small role in male physiology. But because the ovaries secrete far smaller amounts of androgens, females are much more sensitive to disorders of cortical sex hormone production. For example, certain enzyme deﬁciencies in the synthetic pathways of other adrenal cortex hormones result in excess androgen production in the adrenal cortex. Such a deﬁciency would result in no obvious phenotypic eﬀects in a male fetus; however, a genotypic female may be born with ambiguous or masculinized genitalia due to the presence of excess cortical sex hormones. Males can be aﬀected by similar disorders if they lead to excessive production of estrogens. Functions of the corticosteroids: The 3 S’s Sex (cortical sex hormones) Nestled inside the adrenal cortex is the adrenal medulla. A derivative of the nervous system, this organ is responsible for the production of the sympathetic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. e specialized nerve cells in the medulla are capable of secreting these compounds directly into the bloodstream.
*$%pass: Both epinephrine and norepinephrine are amino acid–derivative hormones that belong to a larger class of molecules known Much like the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system, the hormones released from the adrenal medulla have diverse system-wide eﬀects, all centered on the ﬁght-or-ﬂight response. Epinephrine can increase the breakdown of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) in both liver and muscle, as well as increase the basal metabolic rate. Both epinephrine and norepinephrine will increase heart rate, dilate the bronchi, and shunt blood ﬂow to the systems that would be used in a sympathetic response. at is, there is vasodilation of blood vessels leading to increased bloodﬂow to the skeletal muscle, heart, lungs, and brain. Concurrently, vasoconstriction decreases bloodﬂow to the gut, kidneys, and skin. Note that the stress response involves both cortisol and epinephrine. Classically, cortisol is understood to mediate long-term (slow) stress responses, while catecholamines are understood to control short-term (fast) stress responses. In fact, cortisol actually increases the synthesis of catecholamines as well, resulting in an increase in catecholamine release. e pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. Exocrine tissues secrete substances directly into ducts; the pancreas produces a number of digestive enzymes, as discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biology Review. From an endocrine standpoint, small clusters of hormone-producing cells are grouped together into islets of Langerhans throughout the pancreas, as shown in Figure 5.10. Islets contain three distinct types of cells: alpha (α), beta (β), and delta (δ) cells.
*$%pass: Each cell type secretes a diﬀerent hormone: α- cells secrete glucagon, β-cells secrete insulin, and δ-cells secrete gross anatomy of pancreas: pancreatic duct, accessory pancreatic duct, common bilde duct, duodenal papilla and duodenum; microscopic: acini (exocrine) and islets (endocrine) Figure 5.10 Anatomy of the Pancreas Islets of Langerhans are scattered throughout the pancreas and carry out the endocrine function of the organ. Glucagon is secreted during times of fasting. When glucose levels are low, glucagon increases glucose production by triggering glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the degradation of protein and fat. In addition to low blood glucose concentrations, certain gastrointestinal hormones (such as cholecystokinin and gastrin) increase glucagon release from α-cells. When blood glucose concentrations are high, glucagon release is inhibited. Glucagon levels are high when glucose is gone. Insulin is antagonistic to glucagon and is therefore secreted when blood glucose levels are high, as shown in Figure 5.11. Insulin induces muscle and liver cells to take up glucose and store it as glycogen for later use. In addition, because it is active when glucose levels are high, insulin stimulates anabolic processes such as fat and protein synthesis. description given in caption Figure 5.11 Insulin Has a Direct Relationship with Blood Glucose Concentration When blood glucose levels are high, insulin levels rise, causing cells to take up glucose from the blood; when blood glucose levels are low, insulin levels remain low as well. In excess, insulin will cause hypoglycemia, which is characterized by low blood glucose concentration. Underproduction, insuﬃcient secretion, or insensitivity to insulin all can result in diabetes mellitus, which is clinically characterized by hyperglycemia (excess glucose in the blood). In the kidneys, excessive glucose in the ﬁltrate will overwhelm the nephron’s ability to reabsorb glucose, resulting in its presence in the urine.
*$%pass: Because it is an osmotically active particle and does not readily cross the cell membrane, the presence of glucose in the ﬁltrate leads to excess excretion of water and an increase—that is sometimes quite dramatic—in the urine volume. erefore, patients who have diabeties oen report polyuria (increased frequency of urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst). ere are two types of diabetes mellitus. Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is caused by autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas, resulting in low or absent insulin production. People who havw type I diabeties require regular injections of insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and to permit uptake of glucose into cells. Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is the result of receptor-level resistance to the eﬀects of insulin. Type II diabetes mellitus is partially inherited and partially due to environmental factors, such as high-carbohydrate diets and obesity. Certain pharmaceutical agents can be taken orally to help the body more eﬀectively use the insulin it produces. ese individuals require insulin only when their bodies can no longer control glucose levels, even when aided by these medications. Insulin decreases plasma glucose. Glucagon increases plasma glucose. Growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and epinephrine are also capable of increasing plasma glucose. These hormones that raise blood glucose levels are commonly called counterregulatory hormones. Somatostatin is an inhibitor of both insulin and glucagon secretion. High blood glucose and amino acid concentrations stimulate its secretion. Somatostatin is also produced by the hypothalamus, where it decreases growth hormone secretion in addition to its eﬀects on insulin and glucagon. Because reproductive endocrinology is discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of MCAT Biology Review, we oﬀer only a brief overview in this chapter. e testes secrete testosterone in response to stimulation by gonadotropins (LH and FSH).
*$%pass: Testosterone causes sexual diﬀerentiation of the male during gestation and also promotes the development and maintenance of secondary sex characteristics in males, such as axillary and pubic hair, deepening of the voice, and muscle growth. e ovaries secrete estrogen and progesterone in response to gonadotropins. Estrogen is involved in development of the female reproductive system during gestation and also promotes the development and maintenance of secondary sex characteristics in females, such as axillary and pubic hair, breast growth, and body fat redistribution. ese two steroid hormones also govern the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. e pineal gland is located deep within the brain, where it secretes the hormone melatonin. e precise mechanism of this hormone is unclear, although it has been demonstrated to be involved in circadian rhythms. Blood levels of melatonin are at least partially responsible for the sensation of sleepiness. e pineal gland receives projections directly from the retina, but is not involved in vision; it is hypothesized that the pineal gland responds to decreases in light intensity by releasing melatonin. Melatonin has enjoyed somewhat of a wonder drug status over the past decade as it is touted as a remedy for everything from jet lag to aging. Certainly, one effect of melatonin is to cause profound drowsiness, hence its use in “resetting” one’s daily rhythm. Melatonin is available over the counter in health food stores, but the long-term effects of melatonin therapy are currently unknown. In addition to the organs listed above, speciﬁc cells and tissues in other organs exhibit endocrine functions. In the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine tissue can be found in both the stomach and intestine. Many gastrointestinal peptides have been identiﬁed; important ones include secretin, gastrin, and cholecystokinin.
*$%pass: e speciﬁc functions of these hormones are discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biology Review, but as we might expect for the digestive system, the stimulus for release of most of these peptides is the presence of e kidneys play a role in water balance. As mentioned earlier, ADH increases water permeability in the collecting duct, and the renin– angiotensin–aldosterone system increases sodium and water reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. e kidneys also produce erythropoietin, which stimulates bone marrow to increase production of erythrocytes (red blood cells). It is secreted in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. e heart releases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to help regulate salt and water balance. When cells in the atria are stretched from excess blood volume, they release ANP. is hormone promotes excretion of sodium and therefore increases urine volume. is eﬀect is functionally antagonistic to aldosterone because it lowers blood volume and pressure, and has no eﬀect on blood osmolarity. e thymus, located directly behind the sternum, releases thymosin, which is important for proper T-cell development and diﬀerentiation. e thymus atrophies by adulthood, and thymosin levels drop accordingly. e function of T-cells is discussed in Chapter 8 of MCAT Biology Review. A full list of hormones and their actions can be found in Table 5.1 below.

*$%pass: Where does each come from, and what effect does each have on blood glucose 5. Which three hormones are primarily involved in water homeostasis? Where does each come from, and what effect does each have on blood volume and e endocrine system is unique because its organs are not anatomically related. Hormones are produced in a wide variety of locations and can have far-reaching eﬀects throughout the entire organism. e endocrine system allows for integration and execution of the homeostatic parameters that are necessary to ensure proper functioning of the body. For example, we learned that calcium levels are maintained within a narrow concentration range in the plasma by the antagonistic actions of calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (and vitamin D). Each hormone manipulates the steady state of the organism. As you continue your study of the human body, you will ﬁnd that the endocrine system has eﬀects on every system of the body by regulating fuel metabolism, blood ﬂow, growth, and development. In the last section of this chapter, there was a small note on erythropoietin, the hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Don’t interpret this brief mention as an indication that it is relatively unimportant. In fact, every cell of the body (except red blood cells themselves) needs a constant supply of oxygen to accomplish its function. Our bodies take in this oxygen through the respiratory system and then distribute the oxygen to tissues via the circulatory system. In the next two chapters, we will explore each of these systems separately. Recognize, however, that this division is artiﬁcial; indeed, like the body as a whole, the respiratory and circulatory systems are inseparable as they serve a common function: providing oxygen for every working cell in the body.
*$%pass: You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Mechanisms of Hormone Action Endocrine signaling involves the secretion of hormones directly into the bloodstream. e hormones travel to distant target tissues, where they bind to receptors and induce a change in gene expression or cell Peptide hormones are composed of amino acids and are derived from larger precursor proteins that are cleaved during posttranslational Peptide hormones are polar and cannot pass through the plasma ese hormones bind to extracellular receptors, where they trigger the transmission of a second messenger. Each step of the signaling cascade can induce ampliﬁcation of the Peptide hormones exert eﬀects that usually have rapid onset but are ese hormones are water-soluble, so they travel freely in the bloodstream and do not require a special carrier. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol. Steroid hormones are minimally polar and can pass through the ese hormones bind to and promote a conformational change in cytosolic or intranuclear receptors; the hormone–receptor complex binds to DNA, altering the transcription of a particular gene. Steroid hormones exert eﬀects that usually have slow onset but are Because these hormones are lipid-soluble, they cannot dissolve in the bloodstream and must be carried by speciﬁc proteins. Amino acid–derivative hormones are modiﬁed amino acids. eir chemistry shares some features with peptide hormones and some features with steroid hormones; diﬀerent amino acid–derivative hormones share diﬀerent features with these other hormone classes. Common examples are epinephrine, norepinephrine, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine. Hormones can be classiﬁed by their target tissues. Direct hormones have major eﬀects on non-endocrine tissues. Tropic hormones have major eﬀects on other endocrine tissues.
*$%pass: Endocrine Organs and Hormones e hypothalamus is the bridge between the nervous and endocrine e release of hormones from the hypothalamus is mediated by a number of factors, including projections from other parts of the brain, chemo-and baroreceptors in the blood vessels, and negative feedback from other hormones. In negative feedback, the ﬁnal hormone (or product) of a pathway inhibits hormones (or enzymes) earlier in the pathway, maintaining e hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary gland through paracrine release of hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, which directly connects the two organs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) promotes the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) promotes the release of growth hormone. yroid-releasing hormone (TRH) promotes the release of thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH). Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) promotes the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF or dopamine) inhibits the release Interactions with the posterior pituitary occur via the axons of nerves projected by the hypothalamus. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) and oxytocin are synthesized in the hypothalamus and then travel down these axons to the posterior pituitary, where they are released into the bloodstream. e anterior pituitary releases hormones in response to stimulation from the hypothalamus. Four of these (FSH, LH, ACTH, and TSH) are tropic hormones, while three (prolactin, endorphins, and growth hormone) are direct hormones. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes the development of ovarian follicles in females and spermatogenesis in males. Luteinizing hormone (LH) promotes ovulation in females and testosterone production in males. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) promotes the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. yroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) promotes the synthesis and release of triiodothyronine and thyroxine from the thyroid. Prolactin promotes milk production. Endorphins decrease perception of pain and can produce euphoria.
*$%pass: Growth hormone (GH) promotes growth of bone and muscle and shunts glucose to these tissues. It raises blood glucose concentrations. e posterior pituitary releases two hormones produced in the Antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) is secreted in response to low blood volume or increased blood osmolarity and increases reabsorption of water in the collecting duct of the nephron, increasing blood volume and decreasing blood osmolarity. Oxytocin is secreted during childbirth and promotes uterine contractions. It also promotes milk ejection and may be involved in bonding behavior. It is unusual in that it has a positive feedback loop, not negative. e thyroid is located at the base of the neck in front of the trachea; it produces three key hormones. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are produced by follicular cells and contain iodine. ey increase basal metabolic rate and alter the utilization of glucose and fatty acids. yroid hormones are required for proper neurological and physical development in Calcitonin is produced by parafollicular (C) cells. It decreases plasma calcium concentration by promoting calcium excretion in the kidneys, decreasing calcium absorption in the gut, and promoting calcium storage in bone. e parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases blood calcium concentration. PTH decreases excretion of calcium by the kidneys and increases bone resorption directly to increase blood calcium concentration. PTH activates vitamin D, which is necessary for calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut. PTH promotes resorption of phosphate from bone and reduces reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney, but vitamin D promotes absorption of phosphate from the gut; these two eﬀects on phosphate concentration somewhat cancel each other out. e adrenal cortex produces three classes of steroid hormones.
*$%pass: Glucocorticoids such as cortisol and cortisone increase blood glucose concentration, reduce protein synthesis, inhibit the immune system, and participate in the stress response. Glucocorticoid release is stimulated by ACTH. Mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone promote sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, thus increasing water reabsorption. Aldosterone also increases potassium and hydrogen ion excretion. Aldosterone activity is regulated by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, not ACTH. Cortical sex hormones include androgens (like testosterone) and estrogens in both males and females. e adrenal medulla is derived from the nervous system and secretes catecholamines into the bloodstream. Catecholamines include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are involved in the ﬁght-or-ﬂight (sympathetic) response. ese hormones promote glycogenolysis, increase the basal metabolic rate, increase heart rate, dilate the bronchi, and alter blood e endocrine pancreas produces hormones that regulate glucose Glucagon is produced by α-cells and raises blood glucose levels by stimulating protein and fat degradation, glycogenolysis, and Insulin is produced by β-cells and lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose uptake by cells and promoting anabolic processes, like glycogen, fat, and protein synthesis. Somatostatin is produced by δ-cells and inhibits insulin and e gonads produce hormones that are involved in the development and maintenance of the reproductive systems and secondary sex e testes secrete testosterone. e ovaries secrete estrogen and progesterone. e pineal gland releases melatonin, which helps to regulate circadian Other organs may release hormones, even if they are not primarily considered part of the endocrine system. Cells in the stomach and intestine produce hormones like secretin, gastrin, and cholecystokinin. e kidneys secrete erythropoietin, which stimulates bone marrow to produce erythrocytes (red blood cells) in response to low oxygen levels in the blood.
*$%pass: e atria of the heart secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes excretion of salt and water in the kidneys in response to stretching of the atria (high blood volume). e thymus secretes thymosin, which is important for proper T-cell development and diﬀerentiation.

*$%pass: Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Unlike the other hormones listed here, ADH is not secreted by the adrenal cortex and is therefore not a –corticoid. Rather, ADH is a peptide hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary that promotes water reabsorption. e other associations are all correct. A hormone that directly stimulates a non-endocrine target tissue is referred to as a direct hormone. Glancing at the answer choices, we notice that all of the hormones are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. e direct hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary are prolactin, endorphins, and growth hormone (GH). All of the other answer choices are tropic hormones. e tropic hormones of the anterior pituitary include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid-stimulating e parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that functions to increase blood calcium levels. An increase in synthetic activity of the parathyroid glands would lead to an increase in PTH and, therefore, an increase in blood calcium levels through three mechanisms: increased calcium reabsorption in the kidneys (decreased excretion), increased bone resorption, and increased absorption of calcium from the gut (via activation of vitamin Peptide hormones are composed of chains of amino acids and, though they vary in size, are generally too large, charged, and polar to cross the cell membrane. Instead, these hormones bind to extracellular receptors and rely on second messengers to mediate their eﬀects. All of these observations justify (B). Inﬂammation of the thyroid or iodine deﬁciency can cause hypothyroidism, in which the thyroid hormones are undersecreted or not secreted at all. Hypothyroidism in newborn infants causes cretinism, which is characterized by poor neurological and physical development (including intellectual disabilities, short stature, and coarse facial features).
*$%pass: While iodine deﬁciency can result in a swelling of the thyroid gland (called a goiter), which can also be seen in causes of hyperthyroidism, iodine deﬁciency does not cause hyperthyroidism, eliminating (D). Galactorrhea, (A), is associated with prolactin; gigantism, (C), is associated with growth hormone. e hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis includes the secretion of thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus triggering the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the secretion of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) from the thyroid. Overproduction of TRH would promote overproduction of TSH, eliminating (B). Destruction of the follicular cells that produce T3 and T4 would remove negative feedback, allowing TSH levels to rise, eliminating (A) and (D). High levels of T4 would cause too much negative feedback and lower TSH levels, making (C) the correct answer. Steroid hormones are nonpolar cholesterol derivatives and bind to internal receptors. Importantly, as cholesterol derivatives, these hormones generally lack nitrogen and are composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. All of these factors support (B) as the right answer. By contrast, (A) can be eliminated because peptide hormones would localize to the cell surface. And, while amino acid derivatives can signal like steroid hormones, (C) can be eliminated since the chemical composition given in the question stem indicates a lack of nitrogen. (D) can be eliminated since the term “direct” refers to the hormone target, and data about the target of the hormone are not given in this question stem. Pancreatic somatostatin secretion is increased by high blood glucose or amino acid levels, leading to decreased insulin and glucagon secretion, eliminating (A) and (D). Somatostatin is thus always an inhibitory hormone, conﬁrming (B).
*$%pass: e stimuli for somatostatin release include high blood glucose or amino acids, as mentioned above, as well as high levels of certain gastrointestinal hormones, as discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biology Review—but not cortisol, eliminating (C). β-cells are responsible for insulin production. e function of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels by promoting the inﬂux of glucose into cells and by stimulating anabolic processes, such as glycogenesis or fat and protein synthesis. us, destruction of the β-cells would result in a cessation of insulin production, which would lead to hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose e stimulus for renin production is low blood pressure, which causes the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney to produce renin, an enzyme that converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme in the lungs; angiotensin II then stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone helps to restore blood volume by increasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney, leading to an increase in water reabsorption. is removes the initial stimulus for renin production. us, (A), (B), and (C) correctly describe the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, while (D) describes the stimulus for erythropoietin secretion. e question stem indicates that the newly discovered hormone functions as a ﬁrst messenger, stimulating the conversion of ATP to cAMP; cAMP functions as a second messenger, triggering a signaling cascade in the cell. Hormones that act via second messengers and are relatively large in size (short peptides or complex polypeptides) are peptide hormones. is hormone could be a tropic hormone, but it is also entirely possible for it to be a direct hormone; thus, (D) can be Regardless of the cause, the low levels of calcium in the blood require treatment.
*$%pass: While other therapies are more frequently used to treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels), such as calcium gluconate or calcium chloride, administration of parathyroid hormone would also raise blood calcium concentration. Calcitonin would be a poor choice in this case, as this hormone lowers blood calcium concentrations, eliminating (A). Aldosterone and thymosin play no role in calcium homeostasis, eliminating (C) and (D). Both oxytocin and vasopressin (another name for antidiuretic hormone) end with the suﬃx – in; this should hint that they are peptide or amino acid–derivative hormones. ese two hormones are both synthesized by the hypothalamus, but released by the posterior pituitary. Remember that the posterior pituitary does not actually synthesize any hormones itself; rather, it contains the axons that originate in cells in the hypothalamus and is the site of release for Dopamine is used in a number of neurological systems; most relevant to the endocrine system is the fact that dopamine secretion prevents prolactin release. us, an individual taking medications that block dopamine receptors would lose this inhibition on prolactin release and have elevated prolactin levels. e question stem states that an infant who is genotypically female is born with ambiguous genitalia, meaning that the genitalia do not appear to be speciﬁcally female or speciﬁcally male. In a genotypic female, this indicates that the infant was exposed to androgens during the fetal period. In addition, the infant is also losing sodium, causing hyponatremia. is indicates two issues: excess androgens and a lack of aldosterone, a hormone required for proper reuptake of sodium in the kidneys. Both of these hormones are synthesized in the adrenal cortex, making (D) the correct answer. Note that neither of these hormones is regulated by the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal axis, eliminating (A) and (B). Consult your online resources for additional practice.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems Coughing. Fever. Shortness of breath. Hypoxia. All are symptoms of a number of pulmonary diseases, from a ﬂareup of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal) pneumonia, to a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA). is last example is a bit more esoteric and can be brought on by hypersensitivity to anything from dried grass, to rat urine, to mold that grows in hot tubs—what is sometimes called hot tub lung. Not all cases of hot tub lung are severe, but certainly none are enjoyable.
*$%pass: ey are oen misdiagnosed as asthma or bronchitis and may be treated with steroids, which quell the immune system and reduce inﬂammation. Because hot tub lung can potentially go away by itself, antibiotic therapy is not always recommended. As a physician, you may end up simply having to tell your patients that the best way to avoid hot tub lung is to make sure that the tub is cleaned properly and routinely before use. e lesson here isn’t to avoid hot tubs. It’s that the lungs are essential, sensitive organs with delicate membranes that must be protected. Many types of stressors (pathogens, particles, or chemicals) can irritate them and cause respiratory distress. In this chapter, we’ll look at the structure of the lungs and the microanatomy of respiration. We’ll also talk about the mechanics of breathing, as well as the overall function of the lungs. You may be surprised at the low percentage of questions associated with this chapter, given that this chapter touches on several classic MCAT topics including pressure, gases, and equilibrium. And you may see questions on your MCAT that relate to the work done on air in the lungs, for example. However, such a question would depend much more on your general knowledge of work, energy, and gases (regardless of context) than your knowledge of the respiratory system specifically.
*$%pass: Anatomy and Mechanism of Breathing After Chapter 6.1, you will be able to: Identify the muscles involved in inhalation and exhalation Explain the purpose and function of surfactant Recall the mathematical relationships between vital capacity, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, and tidal volume Predict how the brain will alter respiratory rate in response to changing blood levels of O2 and CO2 Order the structures in the pathway that air uses to enter the body, from the nares to the alveoli e lungs are located in the thoracic cavity, the structure of which is specially designed to perform breathing. e anatomy of the respiratory system is summarized in Figure 6.1. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs. Air enters the respiratory tract through the external nares of the nose and then passes through the nasal cavity, where it is ﬁltered by mucous membranes and nasal hairs (vibrissae). Figure 6.1 Anatomy of the Respiratory System The nose and mouth serve several important roles in breathing by removing dirt and particulate matter from the air and warming and humidifying it before it reaches the lungs. Next, air passes into the pharynx and the larynx. e pharynx resides behind the nasal cavity and at the back of the mouth; it is a common pathway for both air destined for the lungs and food destined for the esophagus. In contrast, the larynx lies below the pharynx and is only a pathway for air. To keep food out of the respiratory tract, the opening of the larynx (glottis) is covered by the epiglottis during swallowing. e larynx contains two vocal cords that are maneuvered using skeletal muscle and cartilage. From the larynx, air passes into the cartilaginous trachea and then into one of the two mainstem bronchi.
*$%pass: e bronchi and trachea contain ciliated epithelial cells to catch material that has made it past the mucous membranes in the nose and mouth. In the lungs, the bronchi continue to divide into smaller structures known as bronchioles, which divide further until they end in the tiny balloon-like structures in which gas exchange occurs (alveoli). Each alveolus is coated with surfactant, a detergent that lowers surface tension and prevents the alveolus from collapsing on itself. A network of capillaries surrounds each alveolus to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. e branching and minute size of the alveoli allow for an exceptionally large surface area for gas exchange— approximately 100 m2 in total. The left lung has a small indentation, making it slightly smaller than the right lung. It also contains only two lobes, while the right lung contains three. Why might this be? It is due to the position of the heart in the thoracic cavity. e lungs themselves are contained in the thoracic cavity, which also contains the heart. e chest wall forms the outside of the thoracic cavity. Membranes known as pleurae surround each lung, as shown in Figure 6.2. e pleura forms a closed sac against which the lung expands. e surface adjacent to the lung is the visceral pleura, and the outer part is the parietal Figure 6.2 Lung Membranes e lungs do not ﬁll passively, and require skeletal muscle to generate the negative pressure for expansion. e most important of these muscles is the diaphragm, a thin, muscular structure that divides the thoracic (chest) cavity from the abdominal cavity. e diaphragm is under somatic control, even though breathing itself is under autonomic control.
*$%pass: In addition, muscles of the chest wall, back, and neck may also participate in breathing, especially when breathing is labored due to a pathologic condition. Before we discuss breathing itself, it is worth taking a closer look at the relationship between the pleurae and the lungs. Imagine that you have a large, partially deﬂated balloon. Now, imagine taking your ﬁst and pushing it against the balloon so that the balloon comes up and surrounds your hand. is is analogous to a lung and its pleura. Our ﬁst is the lung, and the balloon represents both pleural layers. e side directly touching our ﬁst is the visceral pleura, and the outer layer is the parietal pleura, which is associated with the chest wall in real life. e space within the sac is referred to as the intrapleural space, which contains a thin layer of ﬂuid. is pleural ﬂuid helps lubricate the two pleural surfaces. e pressure diﬀerentials that can be created across the pleura ultimately drive breathing, as we explore in the next section. The intrapleural space is an example of a potential space—a space that is normally empty or collapsed. In some pathologic states, that potential space can be expanded by fluid or air that accumulates between the two pleural layers. For example, in a pleural effusion, fluid accumulates in the intrapleural space. In a pneumothorax, air collects here. Each of these states disturbs the normal mechanics of the breathing apparatus and can cause atelectasis, or lung collapse. Let’s turn to the mechanics of ventilation, which are grounded in physics. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 of MCAT Physics and Math Review, we can use pressure to do useful work in a system.
*$%pass: Here, we use pressure diﬀerentials between the intrapleural space and the lungs to drive air into Inhalation is an active process. We use our diaphragm as well as the external intercostal muscles (one of the layers of muscles between the ribs) to expand the thoracic cavity, as shown in Figure 6.3. As the diaphragm ﬂattens and the chest wall expands outward, the intrathoracic volume (the volume of the chest cavity) increases. Speciﬁcally, because the intrapleural space most closely abuts the chest wall, its volume increases ﬁrst. Can we predict what will happen to intrapleural pressure? From our understanding of Boyle’s law, an increase in intrapleural volume leads to a decrease in Figure 6.3 Stages of Ventilation The diaphragm contracts during inhalation and relaxes during exhalation. Boyle’s law states that, at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume of gases are inversely related. This is the principle underlying negative-pressure breathing: as the chest wall expands, the pressure in the lungs drops, and air is drawn into the lungs. Now we have low pressure in the intrapleural space. What about inside the lungs? e gas in the lungs is initially at atmospheric pressure, which is now higher than the pressure in the intrapleural space. e lungs will therefore expand into the intrapleural space, and the pressure in the lungs will drop. Air will then be sucked in from a higher-pressure environment—the outside world. is mechanism is referred to as negative-pressure breathing because the driving force is the lower (relatively negative) pressure in the intrapleural space compared with the lungs. Unlike inhalation, exhalation does not have to be an active process. Simple relaxation of the external intercostal muscles will reverse the processes we discussed in the last paragraph. As the diaphragm and external intercostals relax, the chest cavity decreases in volume.
*$%pass: What will happen to pressure in the intrapleural space? It will go up, again explained by Boyle’s law. Now pressure in the intrapleural space is higher than in the lungs, which is still at atmospheric pressure. us, air will be pushed out, resulting in exhalation. During active tasks, we can speed this process up by using the internal intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles, which oppose the external intercostals and pull the rib cage down. is actively decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity. Finally, recall that surfactant prevents the complete collapse of the alveoli during exhalation by reducing surface tension at the Inhalation and exhalation require different amounts of energy expenditure. Muscle contraction is required to create the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity that forces air into the lungs during inspiration. Expiration during calm states is entirely due to elastic recoil of the lungs and the musculature. During more active states, the muscles can be used to force air out and speed up the process of ventilation. Remember the balloon analogy from before. e lungs have a resilient, elastic quality and are attached via the pleurae to the chest wall. e chest wall expands on inhalation, pulling the lungs with it and creating the pressure diﬀerential required for inhalation. As the chest wall relaxes, the lungs recoil due to the intrinsic elastic quality of the lungs and surface tension in the alveoli, accentuating the relaxation process. When the lungs recoil, their volume becomes smaller, and the pressure increases. Now the pressure inside the lungs is higher than the outside pressure, and exhalation occurs. Note that the indirect connection of the lungs to the chest wall also prevents them from collapsing completely on recoil, like surfactant. Emphysema is a disease characterized by the destruction of the alveolar walls.
*$%pass: This results in reduced elastic recoil of the lungs, making the process of exhalation extremely difficult. Most cases of emphysema are caused by cigarette smoking. Lung Capacities and Volumes In pulmonology (the medical ﬁeld associated with the lungs and breathing), we frequently must assess lung capacities and volumes. One instrument used to measure these quantities is a spirometer. While a spirometer cannot measure the amount of air remaining in the lung aer complete exhalation (residual volume), it provides a number of measures that are useful in Commonly tested lung volumes include: Total lung capacity (TLC): e maximum volume of air in the lungs when one inhales completely; usually around 6 to 7 liters Residual volume (RV): e volume of air remaining in the lungs when one exhales completely Vital capacity (VC): e diﬀerence between the minimum and maximum volume of air in the lungs (TLC – RV) Tidal volume (TV): e volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a normal Expiratory reserve volume (ERV): e volume of additional air that can be forcibly exhaled aer a normal exhalation Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV): e volume of additional air that can be forcibly inhaled aer a normal inhalation ese diﬀerent lung volumes and capacities can be seen in Figure 6.4. Figure 6.4 Lung Volumes Regulation of Breathing Breathing requires input from our nervous control center. Ventilation is primarily regulated by a collection of neurons in the medulla oblongata called the ventilation center that ﬁre rhythmically to cause regular contraction of respiratory muscles. ese neurons contain chemoreceptors that are primarily sensitive to carbon dioxide concentration. As the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood rises (hypercarbia or hypercapnia), the respiratory rate will increase so that more carbon dioxide is exhaled, causing carbon dioxide levels in the blood to fall.
*$%pass: ese cells also respond to changes in oxygen concentration, although this tends to have signiﬁcance only during periods of signiﬁcant hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in We can, to a limited extent, control our breathing consciously. We can choose to breathe more rapidly or slowly; however, extended periods of hypoventilation would lead to increased carbon dioxide levels and an override by the medulla oblongata (which would jump-start breathing). e opposite process (hyperventilation) would blow oﬀ too much carbon dioxide and ultimately inhibit ventilation. MCAT Concept Check 6.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. List the structures in the respiratory pathway, from where air enters the nares to 2. Which muscle(s) are involved in inhalation? Exhalation? 3. What is the purpose of surfactant? 4. What is the mathematical relationship between vital capacity (VC), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and tidal volume (TV)? 5. If blood levels of CO2 become too low, how does the brain alter the respiratory rate to maintain homeostasis? Functions of the Respiratory System After Chapter 6.2, you will be able to: Describe the mechanisms used in the respiratory system to prevent infection Recall the chemical equation for the bicarbonate buffer system Predict how blood pH will change in response to changing concentrations of O2 or No organ system functions alone. e lungs function in gas exchange, but this is only part of the respiratory story. e lungs are lined with a tremendous number of capillaries that can also be used in thermoregulation. e lungs also represent a pathway into the body and serve an immune function to prevent invaders from gaining access to the bloodstream. Finally, the lungs also allow for control of blood pH by controlling carbon dioxide concentrations.
*$%pass: erefore, the lungs are integrated with many other body systems, including the cardiovascular, immune, renal, and nervous Gas exchange is, of course, the primary function of the lungs. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries. e capillaries bring deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary arteries, which originate from the right ventricle of the heart. e walls of the alveoli are only one cell thick, which facilitates the diﬀusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs, and oxygen into the blood. e oxygenated blood returns to the le atrium of the heart via the pulmonary veins. Diffusion of gases occurs across a very thin membrane between the alveolus and the capillary. However, certain diseases may cause fibrosis, or scarring, of this membrane, resulting in less effective diffusion. Other diseases may cause a limitation of ventilation (gas flow) or perfusion (blood flow) to the lung. All of these mechanisms can cause hypoxia—low blood oxygen levels—although they accomplish that same end result through different e driving force for gas exchange is the pressure diﬀerential of the gases. When it initially arrives at the alveoli, blood has a relatively low partial pressure of oxygen and a relatively high partial pressure of carbon dioxide, facilitating transfer of each down its respective concentration gradient, as shown in Figure 6.5. Because the gradient between the blood and air in the lungs is already present as the blood enters the lungs, no energy is required for gas transfer. Figure 6.5 Gas Exchange in the Alveolus O2 in the alveoli flows down its partial pressure gradient from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, where it can bind to hemoglobin for transport. Meanwhile, CO2 flows down its partial pressure gradient from the capillaries into the alveoli for expiration.
*$%pass: How would our respiratory systems adjust if we moved to higher altitudes where less oxygen is available? First, we would breathe more rapidly to try to avoid hypoxia; second, the binding dynamics of hemoglobin to oxygen would be altered to facilitate the unloading of oxygen at the tissues. As we will discuss in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biology Review, the natural response of hemoglobin to the decreased carbon dioxide concentration in the environment would actually be to decrease the unloading of oxygen to tissues, so other mechanisms must counteract and override this phenomenon. In the short term, the body can make more red blood cells to ensure the adequate delivery of oxygen. In the long term, the body could develop more blood vessels (vascularization), which would facilitate the distribution of oxygen to tissues. In order to maximize gas exchange, there is a tremendous surface area over which the alveoli and capillaries interact. Because the entire respiratory tract is highly vascular, it can also be used for thermoregulation, or the regulation of body temperature. Heat—the transfer of thermal energy—is regulated via the body surfaces by vasodilation and vasoconstriction. As capillaries expand, more blood can pass through these vessels, and a larger amount of thermal energy can be dissipated. As capillaries contract, less blood can pass through them, conserving thermal energy. Nasal and tracheal capillaries are most frequently used for these purposes within the respiratory system. While these capillary beds provide a mechanism for thermoregulation, humans predominantly regulate temperature using capillaries and sweat glands in the skin, or rapid muscle contraction (shivering). e respiratory system can also transfer heat to the environment through evaporation of water in mucous secretions. Other animals, such as dogs, take advantage of this cooling mechanism by panting.
*$%pass: As mentioned above, the lungs provide a large interface for the body to interact with the outside world. While this is important for gas exchange and thermoregulation, it also comes with potential risks—pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause infections in the lung, or can gain access to the body through the rich vascularity of the alveolar membranes. By necessity, the lungs must be able to ﬁght oﬀ potential invaders. e ﬁrst line of defense is the nasal cavity, which has small hairs (vibrissae) that help to trap particulate matter and potentially infectious particles. e nasal cavity also contains an enzyme called lysozyme. Also found in tears and saliva, lysozyme is able to attack the peptidoglycan walls of gram-positive bacteria. e internal airways are lined with mucus, which traps particulate matter and larger invaders. Underlying cilia then propel the mucus up the respiratory tract to the oral cavity, where it can be expelled or swallowed; this mechanism is called the mucociliary escalator. The division within the sciences is largely artificial; the MCAT often contains questions that integrate multiple science disciplines. A question located in the Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems section may require knowledge of general chemistry. In fact, 10% of this section is chemistry: 5% general chemistry and 5% organic chemistry. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung most often caused by bacteria or viruses. Atypical pneumonia, commonly called walking pneumonia (because the infection does not require hospitalization and does not leave the patient bedridden), is often caused by a very small bacterium called Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This bacterium causes a prolonged cough because it damages epithelial cells lining the lung and paralyzes the cilia lining the respiratory tract. The lack of cilia makes it much more difficult to clear mucus from the lungs.
*$%pass: The cough lasts until the respiratory epithelial cells have recovered and the cilia are once again functional. e lungs, especially the alveoli, also contain numerous immune cells, including macrophages. Macrophages can engulf and digest pathogens and signal to the rest of the immune system that there is an invader. Mucosal surfaces also contain IgA antibodies that help to protect against pathogens that contact the mucous membranes. Finally, mast cells also populate the lungs. ese cells have preformed antibodies on their surfaces. When the right substance attaches to the antibody, the mast cell releases inﬂammatory chemicals into the surrounding area to promote an immune response. Unfortunately, these antibodies are oen reactive to substances such as pollen and molds, so mast cells also provide the inﬂammatory chemicals that mediate allergic reactions. Control of pH e respiratory system plays a role in pH balance through the bicarbonate buﬀer system in the blood: Metabolic acidosis—a condition of excess acid by any mechanism besides hypoventilation —is a common occurrence in medicine. Anaerobic respiration can generate lactic acid; individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus can produce ketoacids when they are hypoinsulinemic; certain poisons, like methanol and formaldehyde, can produce organic acids. In each of these cases, one of the primary methods of compensation is increasing Questions regarding the bicarbonate buﬀer system are MCAT favorites, and you are very likely to see it in some form on Test Day. is equation represents an opportunity for the MCAT to test understanding of basic chemistry concepts, such as Le Châtelier’s principle, as well as how disturbances in pH may aﬀect respiration. e body attempts to maintain a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
*$%pass: When the pH is lower, and hydrogen ion concentration is higher (acidemia), acid-sensing chemoreceptors just outside the blood–brain barrier send signals to the brain to increase the respiratory rate. Further, an increasing hydrogen ion concentration will cause a shi in the bicarbonate buﬀer system, generating additional carbon dioxide. As described earlier, the respiratory centers in the brain are sensitive to this increasing partial pressure of carbon dioxide and will also promote an increase in respiratory rate. As the respiratory rate increases, more carbon dioxide is blown oﬀ. is will also push the buﬀer equation to the le, but notice the diﬀerence: the shi to the le in the previous paragraph was caused by an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, which elevated the concentration of carbon dioxide. Here, the removal of carbon dioxide causes a shi to the le that allows the hydrogen ion concentration to drop back to normal. If H+ is an acid and is a base, then why doesn’t increasing both of them yield a constant pH? The reason is that H+ is a strong acid, while is a weak base. Just like a titration, discussed in Chapter 10 of MCAT General Chemistry Review, this combination will shift the pH of the solution toward the acidic range. If the blood is too basic (alkalemia), then the body will seek to increase acidity. How can the lungs contribute to this? If the respiratory rate is slowed, then more carbon dioxide will be retained, shiing the buﬀer equation to the right and producing more hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. is results in a lower pH. This equation is essential to Test Day success: It is likely to be tested in both the Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems and the Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems sections.
*$%pass: Overall, the lungs play a role in the immediate adjustment of carbon dioxide levels and, by extension, hydrogen ion levels. However, the lungs do not work alone to maintain proper pH. e kidneys also play a role by modulating secretion and reabsorption of acid and base within the nephron. is is a much slower response, however, and represents long-term compensation. For more information on kidney function and homeostasis, see Chapter 10 of MCAT Biology Review. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Chronic inhalation of crystalline silica has been shown to result in silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis and may also play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. The mechanism by which these pathologies develop is not clearly understood, but oxidant/antioxidant imbalances have been suggested. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (Sod3) is one of the most abundant antioxidant enzymes in the pulmonary vasculature. To study the role of Sod3 in the development of silica-mediated pathologies, scientists injected a crystalline silica suspension into the trachea of WT and Sod3–/– mice. 28 days later, a pressure catheter was inserted into the right ventricle through the jugular vein to measure the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (Figure 1). Elevated RVSP is associated with pulmonary hypertension. Following the RVSP measurement, mice were sacrificed. mRNA was extracted from lung tissue and assayed for Sod3 Background info: silica damages the lungs, maybe through Researcher thought process: this enzyme is most prevalent in the blood vessels around the lungs, so let’s test it first! Experimental set up: compare silica-induced lung pathologies between WT and Sod3–/– Exp 1: measured RVSP; high RVSP = pulmonary hypertension Exp 2: measuring Sod3 gene expression (Figure 2). Lung sections were stained with Mason’s trichrome to visualize collagen, a marker of pulmonary fibrosis (Figure 3).
*$%pass: Exp 3: quantifying collagen content in the lungs; increased collagen in lungs = fibrosis In all three figures, IV = silica treatment and presence or absence of Sod3 Figure 1 DV: RVSP Trend: RVSP appears highest in Sod3 KO mice treated with silica DV: Sod3 expression Trend: silica treatment decreases Sod3 expression in normal mice DV: collagen in lungs Trend: highest in Sod3 KO mice treated with silica Adapted from Zelko, I. N., Zhu, J., & Roman, J. (2018). Role of SOD3 in silica-related lung ﬁbrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Respiratory Research, 19(1), 221. Based on the findings of this study, does Sod3 protect against or exacerbate crystalline silica-induced pathologies? is question is really testing our understanding of how the presence or absence of Sod3 aﬀects the development of silica-induced lung pathologies. Finding an answer will require a strong understanding of the experimental design and careful analysis of the data. Let’s start with the experimental design. Paragraph 2 tells us that we have three experimental groups: normal mice not treated with silica, normal mice treated with silica, and Sod3 knockout (KO) mice treated with silica. e normal mice lacking treatment serve as a negative control, whereas the normal mice treated with silica serve as the positive control. Paragraph 1 tells us that crystalline silica has already been shown to cause pulmonary ﬁbrosis and silicosis, so we should expect to see indicators of these pathologies in normal mice treated with silica, but not in the untreated mice. If Sod3 has a protective role, deleting it should lead to an increase in lung damage. If Sod3 exacerbates silica-induced lung damage, deleting it should lead to a decrease in lung damage. Time to analyze the data!
*$%pass: Figure 1 shows that in normal mice, exposure to silica leads to an increase in RVSP, indicating a potential role for silica in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, deletion of Sod3 leads to a greater elevation in RVSP, suggesting that Sod3 may have a protective role. Figure 2 shows the expression of the Sod3 transcript in lung tissue. e Sod3 KO mice show no expression, which is consistent with a gene knockout. We also note that the silica exposure leads to a decrease in Sod3 expression. Figure 3 shows an elevation in collagen content in the lungs of silica-treated mice compared to untreated mice. is elevation is signiﬁcantly higher in Sod3 KO mice. Taken together, these results suggest that Sod3 protects against both silica-induced pulmonary ﬁbrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Because knockout of Sod3 lead to an increase in pulmonary ﬁbrosis and pulmonary hypertension aer exposure to crystalline silica, Sod3 most likely serves a protective role in the lungs against silica- MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 6.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are some of the mechanisms used in the respiratory system to prevent 2. What is the chemical equation for the bicarbonate buffer system? 3. Respiratory failure refers to inadequate ventilation to provide oxygen to the tissues. How would the pH change in respiratory failure? As we learn about the human body, it may be easy to reduce the complex and varied functions of the lungs to breathing and providing a supply of oxygen. e lungs do indeed perform gas exchange, which relies on diﬀerences in partial pressures of gases between the alveoli and the blood. Oxygen is taken up by the blood, while carbon dioxide is released for exhalation.
*$%pass: Inhalation and exhalation also require pressure diﬀerentials created by anatomical structures such as the chest wall, diaphragm, pleurae, However, the lungs are so much more than just bags of air; gas exchange is not the only function of the respiratory system. e respiratory system also serves essential roles in thermoregulation, immunity, and pH regulation. As we go through the individual systems within the human body, take special note of how each system is integrated with the other systems. One of the more clear connections is the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the lungs and in the rest of the circulatory system—a concept we will expand upon in the next chapter, along with the eﬀects of altitude, pH, and chemicals on this You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Anatomy and Mechanism of Breathing Air is drawn in through the nares, and through the nasal cavity and pharynx, where it is warmed and humidiﬁed. It is ﬁltered by nasal hairs (vibrissae) and mucous membranes. It then enters the larynx, followed by the trachea. e trachea divides into two mainstem bronchi, which divide into bronchioles, which divide into continually smaller passages until they reach the alveoli. Alveoli are small sacs that interface with the pulmonary capillaries, allowing gases to diﬀuse across a one-cell-thick membrane. Surfactant in the alveoli reduces surface tension at the liquid–gas interface, preventing collapse. e pleurae cover the lungs and line the chest wall. e visceral pleura lies adjacent to the lung itself. e parietal pleura lines the chest wall. e intrapleural space lies between these two layers and contains a thin layer of ﬂuid that lubricates the two pleural surfaces.
*$%pass: e diaphragm is a thin skeletal muscle that helps to create the pressure diﬀerential required for breathing. Inhalation is an active process. e diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expand the thoracic cavity, increasing the volume of the intrapleural space. is decreases the intrapleural pressure. is pressure diﬀerential ultimately expands the lungs, dropping the pressure within and drawing in air from the environment. is mechanism is termed negative-pressure breathing. Exhalation may be passive or active. In passive exhalation, relaxation of the muscles of inspiration and elastic recoil of the lungs allow the chest cavity to decrease in volume, reversing the pressure diﬀerentials seen in inhalation. In active exhalation, the internal intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles can be used to forcibly decrease the volume of the thoracic cavity, pushing out air. A spirometer can be used to measure lung capacities and volumes. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume of air in the lungs when one inhales completely. Residual volume (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs when one exhales completely. Vital capacity (VC) is the diﬀerence between the minimum and maximum volume of air in the lungs. Tidal volume (TV) is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the volume of additional air that can be forcibly exhaled aer a normal exhalation. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is the volume of additional air that can be forcibly inhaled aer a normal inhalation. Ventilation is regulated by the ventilation center, a collection of neurons in the medulla oblongata. Chemoreceptors respond to carbon dioxide concentrations, increasing the respiratory rate when there is a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercarbia or hypercapnia). e ventilation center can also respond to low oxygen concentrations in the blood (hypoxemia) by increasing ventilation rate.
*$%pass: Ventilation can also be controlled consciously through the cerebrum, although the medulla oblongata will override the cerebrum during extended periods of hypo- or hyperventilation. Functions of the Respiratory System e lungs perform gas exchange with the blood through simple diﬀusion across concentration gradients. Deoxygenated blood with a high carbon dioxide concentration is brought to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. Oxygenated blood with a low carbon dioxide concentration leaves the lungs via the pulmonary veins. e large surface area of interaction between the alveoli and capillaries allows the respiratory system to assist in thermoregulation through vasodilation and vasoconstriction of capillary beds. e respiratory system must be protected from potential pathogens. Multiple mechanisms, including vibrissae, mucous membranes, and the mucociliary escalator, help ﬁlter the incoming air and trap Lysozyme in the nasal cavity and saliva attacks peptidoglycan cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. Macrophages can engulf and digest pathogens and signal to the rest of the immune system that there is an invader. Mucosal surfaces are covered with IgA antibodies. Mast cells have antibodies on their surface that, when triggered, can promote the release of inﬂammatory chemicals. Mast cells are oen involved in allergic reactions as well. e respiratory system is involved in pH control through the bicarbonate buﬀer system. When blood pH decreases, respiration rate increases to compensate by blowing oﬀ carbon dioxide. is causes a le shi in the buﬀer equation, reducing hydrogen ion concentration. When blood pH increases, respiration rate decreases to compensate by trapping carbon dioxide. is causes a right shi in the buﬀer equation, increasing hydrogen ion concentration. Answers to Concept Checks 1. Nares nasal cavity pharynx larynx trachea bronchi bronchioles alveoli 2. Inhalation uses the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles; in labored breathing, muscles of the neck and back may also be involved.
*$%pass: Passive exhalation uses the recoil of these same muscles; active exhalation also uses the internal intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles. 3. Surfactant reduces surface tension at the air–liquid interface in the alveoli. is prevents their collapse. 4. Vital capacity is the sum of the inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, and tidal volume: VC = IRV + ERV + TV 5. When CO2 levels become too low, the brain can decrease the respiratory rate in order to raise CO2 levels. 1. Immune mechanisms in the respiratory system include vibrissae in the nares, lysozyme in the mucous membranes, the mucociliary escalator, macrophages in the lungs, mucosal IgA antibodies, and mast cells. 3. In respiratory failure, ventilation slows, and less carbon dioxide is blown oﬀ. As this occurs, the buﬀer equation shis to the right, and more hydrogen ions are generated. is results in a lower pH of the blood. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Gas exchange in the lungs relies on passive diﬀusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. is is accomplished easily because there is always a diﬀerence in the partial pressures of these two gases and because the subdivision of the respiratory tree creates a large surface area of interaction between the alveoli and the circulatory system. In addition, the thin alveolar walls allow for fast diﬀusion and gas exchange. erefore, (A), (B), and (C) can be eliminated. (D) is the correct answer because active transport is not used in the gas exchange process in the lungs. e muscles involved in ventilation are the diaphragm, which separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity, and the intercostal muscles. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and ﬂattens, while the external intercostal muscles contract, pulling the rib cage up and out. ese actions cause an overall increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity.
*$%pass: During exhalation, both the diaphragm and the external intercostals relax, causing a decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity because of the recoil of these tissues. In forced exhalation, the internal intercostals and abdominal muscles may contract to force out air. us, the only correct association from the given answers is (D). Total lung capacity is equal to the vital capacity (the maximum volume of air that can be forcibly inhaled and exhaled from the lungs) plus the residual volume (the air that always remains in the lungs, preventing the alveoli from collapsing). During inhalation, the chest cavity expands, causing expansion of the intrapleural space. According to Boyle’s law, an increase in volume at a constant temperature is accompanied by a decrease in pressure. When the intrapleural pressure (and, by extension, the alveolar pressure) is less than atmospheric pressure, air enters the lungs. During exhalation, these pressure gradients reverse; thus, during exhalation, intrapleural pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure, not lower. e intrapleural space, bounded by the parietal and visceral pleurae, is a potential space. As such, it is normally collapsed and contains a small amount of ﬂuid. However, introduction of ﬂuid or air into the intrapleural space can ﬁll the space, causing collapse of the lung. e other options listed are too ﬁrmly apposed to permit blood to collect in these spaces. e pharynx, which lies behind the nasal cavity and oral cavity, is a common pathway for food entering the digestive system and air entering the respiratory system. It is the larynx that contains the vocal cords, not the pharynx. Air enters the respiratory tract through the external nares (nostrils) and travels through the nasal cavities. It then passes through the pharynx and into the larynx.
*$%pass: Ingested food also passes through the pharynx on its way to the esophagus; to ensure that food does not accidentally enter the larynx, the epiglottis covers the larynx during swallowing. Aer the larynx, air goes to the trachea, which eventually divides into two bronchi, one for each lung. e bronchi branch into smaller bronchioles, which terminate in clusters of alveoli. From the given sequences, only (D) correctly describes the sequence of the passages through which air travels. In a patient with IPF, the increased stiﬀness of the lungs would likely decrease the volume of air the individual could inhale, which would decrease both the total lung capacity and inspiratory reserve volume. However, spirometry cannot measure the total lung capacity accurately because it cannot determine the residual volume—the volume of air le in the lungs when an individual has maximally exhaled. Because the residual volume makes up a portion of the total lung capacity (total lung capacity = vital capacity + residual volume), a spirometer cannot be used to determine the total lung capacity. erefore, while Statement I is a true statement about individuals with IPF, it cannot appear in the answer choice. Finally, increased stiﬀness of the lungs would be expected to decrease the residual volume, not increase it; further, residual volume, as described above, cannot be measured with a spirometer. Lysozyme is an enzyme present in the nasal cavity, saliva, and tears that degrades peptidoglycan, preventing infection by gram-positive bacteria. us, premature infants who lack lysozyme are more likely to suﬀer from infections with these organisms. If an area of the lung becomes ﬁlled with mucus and inﬂammatory cells, the area will not be able to participate in gas exchange.
*$%pass: Because no air will enter or leave the area, the concentration gradient will no longer exist, and neither oxygen nor carbon dioxide will be able to diﬀuse across the alveolar wall. When people hyperventilate, their respiratory rate increases. When the respiratory rate increases, more carbon dioxide is blown oﬀ. is causes a shi to the le in the bicarbonate buﬀer equation, and the blood becomes more alkaline. Breathing into the bag allows some of this carbon dioxide to be returned to the bloodstream in order to maintain the proper pH. When a patient who has an asthma attack does not respond to treatment and has been hyperventilating for over an hour, the patient may become fatigued and may not be able to maintain hyperventilation. In this case, the patient’s breathing rate starts to decrease, and the patient fails to receive adequate oxygen. By extension, carbon dioxide is trapped in the blood, and the pH begins to drop. Despite the fact that this pH is normal at the moment, this patient is crashing and may start demonstrating acidemia in the near future. While the kidneys should compensate for alkalemia, this is a slow process and would not normalize the blood pH within an hour; further, adequate compensation by the kidneys would actually be a reassuring sign, eliminating (A). ere is no evidence to suggest that the measurement was inaccurate, eliminating (B). Finally, aer treatment, the patient should return to a normal blood pH with adequate ventilation and would not be expected to overcompensate by becoming acidemic, is question requires a few diﬀerent levels of thinking. e question stem states that premature infants oen require ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressures.
*$%pass: While you are not expected to know ventilator settings for the MCAT, you should be able to decode what this phrase means: at the end of expiration, the ventilator will provide a higher pressure than normal, which forces extra air into the alveoli. is pressure must be used to prevent alveolar collapse, which should remind you that surfactant serves the same purpose by reducing surface tension. us, it makes sense that if premature babies lack surfactant, providing extra air pressure at the end of expiration would be beneﬁcial. e intrinsic elastic properties of the lung are important during exhalation as the passive recoil of lung tissue helps decrease lung volume. With decreased recoil, the patient will have diﬃculty exhaling completely, increasing the residual volume. e total lung capacity would be expected to increase in this case because there would be less recoil opposing inhalation, eliminating (B). With decreased alveolar surface area, one would expect decreased gas exchange, which would decrease blood concentrations of oxygen while increasing blood concentrations of carbon dioxide, eliminating (C) and (D). Allergic reactions occur when a substance binds to an antibody and promotes an overactive immune response with inﬂammatory chemicals. e antibody is already attached to a mast cell. us, when the substance binds to the antibody, the mast cell can release the inﬂammatory mediators that cause allergic reactions.

The Cardiovascular System In This Chapter Anatomy of the Cardiovascular System Physiology of the Cardiovascular System Gas and Solute Exchange The content in this chapter should be relevant to about 6% of all questions about biology on the MCAT. This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems As late as the 19th century, physicians adhered to a doctrine of health known as humoralism. is theory, developed by Greek and Roman physicians and philosophers and adopted by Islamic physicians, remained dominant in medical thought and practice until it was displaced by modern medical research in the 1800s. e theory of humoralism holds that the human body is composed of four ﬂuids or substances called humors: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. In the healthy state, these four humors are in balance, but excess or deﬁciency of any one of them would cause illness, disease, and even maladaptive personality characteristics. Over the course of a lifetime the levels of each of the four humors would rise and fall in accordance with diet and activity, resulting in maladies reﬂective of the imbalance. Treatments were intended to restore this balance. Perhaps one of the most well-known treatments associated with humoralism is the practice of bloodletting.
*$%pass: Because many diseases were associated with an excess of blood, physicians would withdraw signiﬁcant amounts of blood from their patients to restore balance to the four humors. Methods for bloodletting were many, and some were dramatic—including drawing blood from major veins in the arm or neck and puncturing arteries. Devices known as scariﬁcators were developed to cut into the superﬁcial vessels. Most famously, leeches were used (especially in the early 19th century) to draw out excess blood. In fact, in the early decades of the 1800s, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by European physicians; in the 1830s, France alone imported about 40 million leeches per year for medical treatments. While the humoral theory has been completely discredited by modern science, some practices associated with humoralism are still being used, albeit based on very diﬀerent medical understanding and for diﬀerent purposes. For example, new research has shown that medicinal leeches can be used eﬀectively in microsurgery to help prevent blood coagulation, and in reconstructive surgery to stimulate circulation to the reattached tissue. e cardiovascular system is one of the most commonly tested organ systems on the MCAT. It serves a variety of functions, including the movement of respiratory gases, nutrients, and wastes. We will review the structures and functional anatomy of the cardiovascular system and then discuss blood and its functional components. We’ll also trace the pathways created by the electrically excitable cells that initiate and spread contractions through the heart. A quick recap of genetics and inheritance will help explain the consequences of ABO and Rh antigens. In addition, the binding of oxygen and carbon dioxide to hemoglobin will be discussed in detail.
*$%pass: Anatomy of the Cardiovascular System After Chapter 7.1, you will be able to: Recall the names of the chambers and valves of the heart Describe the chain of events in the conduction system of the heart that leads to Identify autonomic inputs into the heart and their effects Distinguish between arteries, capillaries, and veins Explain why the right side of the heart is less muscular than the left side Trace the flow of blood through the heart: e cardiovascular system consists of a muscular four-chambered heart, blood vessels, and blood, as shown in Figure 7.1. e heart acts as a pump, distributing blood through the vasculature. e vasculature consists of arteries, capillaries, and veins. Aer blood travels through veins, it is returned to the right side of the heart where it is pumped to the lungs to be reoxygenated. en, the oxygenated blood returns to the le side of the heart where it is once again pumped to the rest of the body. Figure 7.1 Anatomy of the Cardiovascular System e heart is a four-chambered structure composed predominantly of cardiac muscle. We oen speak of the heart as a pump, supporting a single circulatory system. However, the heart is actually composed of two pumps supporting two diﬀerent circulations in series. e right side of the heart accepts deoxygenated blood returning from the body and moves it to the lungs by way of the pulmonary arteries; this constitutes the ﬁrst pump (pulmonary circulation). e second pump is the le side of the heart, which receives oxygenated blood from the lungs by way of the pulmonary veins and forces it out to the body through the aorta (systemic circulation). Each side of the heart consists of an atrium and a ventricle.
*$%pass: e atria are thin-walled structures where blood is received from either the venae cavae (deoxygenated blood entering the right side of the heart) or the pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood entering the le side of the heart). e atria contract to push blood into the ventricles. Aer the ventricles ﬁll, they contract to send blood to the lungs (right ventricle) and the systemic circulation (le ventricle). Note that the ventricles are far more muscular than the atria, allowing for more powerful contractions that are necessary to push blood through the rest of the body. e atria are separated from the ventricles by the atrioventricular valves. Likewise, the ventricles are separated from the vasculature by the semilunar valves. ese valves allow the heart muscle to create the pressure within the ventricles necessary to propel the blood forward within the circulation, while also preventing backﬂow of blood. e valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle is known as the tricuspid valve (three leaﬂets), while the valve between the le atrium and the le ventricle is known as the mitral or bicuspid valve (two leaﬂets). e valve that separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary circulation is known as the pulmonary valve, while the valve that separates the le ventricle from the aorta is known as the aortic valve. Both semilunar valves have three leaﬂets. Atrioventricular valves: LAB RAT Left Atrium = Bicuspid Right Atrium = Tricuspid One of the central themes in biology is something that we’ve touched on already in previous chapters: structure and function are related. e right and le sides of the heart are two diﬀerent pumps, with the right side of the heart pumping blood to the lungs, and the le side of the heart pumping blood into the systemic circulation.
*$%pass: Blood leaving the le side of the heart must travel a considerable distance, so blood pressure must be maintained as far away as the feet. us, the le side of the heart is more muscular than the right side of the heart. In fact, if the right side of the heart were as muscular as the le and pumped blood as forcefully, this would damage the lungs. Electrical Conduction in the Heart e coordinated, rhythmic contraction of cardiac muscle originates in an electrical impulse generated by and traveling through a pathway formed by four electrically excitable structures, as shown in Figure 7.2. is commonly tested pathway consists of, in order of excitation: the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the bundle of His (AV bundle) and its branches, and the Purkinje ﬁbers. Impulse initiation occurs at the SA node, which generates 60–100 signals per minute without requiring any neurological input. is small collection of cells is located in the wall of the right atrium. As the depolarization wave spreads from the SA node, it causes the two atria to contract simultaneously. While most ventricular ﬁlling is passive (that is, blood moves from the atria to the ventricles based solely on ventricular relaxation), atrial systole (contraction) results in an increase in atrial pressure that forces a little more blood into the ventricles. is additional volume of blood is called the atrial kick and accounts for about 5–30 percent of cardiac output. Next, the signal reaches the AV node, which sits at the junction of the atria and ventricles. e signal is delayed here to allow the ventricles to ﬁll completely before they contract.
*$%pass: e signal then travels down the bundle of His and its branches, embedded in the interventricular septum (wall), and to the Purkinje ﬁbers, which distribute the electrical signal through the ventricular muscle. e muscle cells are connected by intercalated discs, which contain many gap junctions directly connecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. is allows for coordinated Figure 7.2 Electrical Conduction System of the Heart Electrical impulses travel from the SA node to the AV node, through the bundle of His, and finally to the Purkinje fibers. Cardiac muscle has myogenic activity, meaning that it can contract without any neurological input. The SA node generates about 60–100 beats per minute, even if all innervation to the heart is cut. The neurological input to the heart is important in speeding up and slowing the rate of contraction, but not generating it in the first place. The heart’s electrical impulses can be detected on the body’s surface by placing electrodes on the skin on opposite sides of the heart. A recording of these currents is called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG; the K, by the way, reflects the German spelling). Electrocardiograms are incredibly powerful tools for assessing the status of a patient’s heart. A normal EKG is shown below. Depolarization precedes cardiac muscle contraction, so the electrical spikes of the EKG occur just before a cardiac contractile event. The P-wave occurs immediately before the atria contract, and the QRS complex occurs just before the ventricles contract. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization. e SA node has an intrinsic rhythm of 60–100 signals per minute, so the normal human heart rate is 60–100 beats per minute. Highly conditioned athletes may have heart rates signiﬁcantly lower than 60, in the range of 40– 50 beats per minute.
*$%pass: Stress, exercise, excitement, surprise, or danger can cause the heart rate to rise signiﬁcantly above 100. e circulatory system is under autonomic control. e autonomic system consists of the sympathetic (“ﬁght-or-ﬂight”) and parasympathetic (“rest- and-digest”) branches, controls the heart and aﬀects the vasculature. Sympathetic signals speed up the heart rate and increase the contractility of cardiac muscle, while parasympathetic signals, provided by the vagus nerve, slow down the heart rate. e heart is a muscle that must contract in order to move blood. Each heartbeat is composed of two phases, known as systole and diastole. During systole, ventricular contraction and closure of the AV valves occurs and blood is pumped out of the ventricles. During diastole, the ventricles are relaxed, the semilunar valves are closed, and blood from the atria ﬁlls the ventricles. Contraction of the ventricles generates a higher pressure during systole, whereas their relaxation during diastole causes the pressure to decrease. e elasticity of the walls of the large arteries, which stretch to receive the volume of blood from the heart, allows the vessels to maintain suﬃcient pressure while the ventricular muscles are relaxed. In fact, if it weren’t for the elasticity of the large arteries, diastolic blood pressure would plummet to zero. e normal events of one heartbeat, including pressures in the le atrium, le ventricle, and aorta; le ventricular volume; normal and pathologic heart sounds; and an EKG are shown in Figure 7.3. Figure 7.3 The Cardiac Cycle The MCAT will not expect a thorough understanding of every detail of this diagram; it is more important to see how the changes in valves (open or closed), pressures, and volumes are related. A measure to be aware of is cardiac output, or the total blood volume pumped by a ventricle in a minute.
*$%pass: Does it matter which ventricle one chooses? As mentioned previously, the two pumps are connected in series, so the volumes of blood passing through each side must be the same, much like the electrical current between two resistors in series must be the same. Cardiac output (CO) is the product of heart rate (HR, beats per minute) and stroke volume (SV, volume of blood pumped per beat): CO = HR × SV The rhythmic impulses we hear when we listen to someone’s heart with a stethoscope (lub dub) are referred to as the heart sounds. The first sound, S1, is produced when the two AV valves close at the start of systole to prevent backflow into the atria. The second sound, S2, is produced when the two semilunar valves close at the end of systole to prevent backflow into the ventricles. Extra heart sounds (S3 and S4) can result from stiffness of the heart muscle or high blood pressure. Heart murmurs, which may be so loud as to be audible without a stethoscope, may arise when the valves malfunction and become either narrow and stiff or wide and floppy, resulting in abnormal flow patterns across the valve. There is a limit to how fast the heart can beat and still pump blood effectively. Because the heart fills with blood when it is relaxing (diastole), the faster it beats, the less time there is for blood to enter the heart during relaxation. Thus, a faster heartbeat means diminishing returns in terms of the amount of blood supplied to the body. A dangerous condition called ventricular tachycardia (often abbreviated v-tach) features a very rapid rate of ventricular contraction. The heart in v-tach cannot properly fill with blood and, paradoxically, stops pumping blood despite its fast rate. Systemic pressures drop precipitously.
*$%pass: Death will result unless the heart is forced out of this abnormal rhythm. For humans, cardiac output is about 5 liters per minute. During periods of exercise or rest, the autonomic nervous system will increase (sympathetic) or decrease (parasympathetic) cardiac output, respectively. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking To further investigate the effects of atorvastatin on post-myocardial infarction recovery, left ventricular myocardial infarction was artificially induced in rats. Rats were randomly assigned to atorvastatin or vehicle treatment. After four weeks, the left ventricles of all rats were examined. Results are summarized in Figures This isn’t the full article, just the results! This is fairly common on Vehicle means to give the base A lot of times it is just saline, and serves as a IVs: vehicle or LVEDP, Ees, and the volume range Ees, and PRSW Figure 1 Representative pressure-volume cardiac cycle loops from a vehicle-treated rat (A) and an atorvastatin-treated rat (B) recorded during preload manipulation by a brief period of inferior vena cava occlusion.

Adapted from Tang X-L, Sanganalmath SK, Sato H, Bi Q, Hunt G, Vincent RJ, et al. (2011) Atorvastatin therapy during the peri-infarct period attenuates le ventricular dysfunction and remodeling aer myocardial infarction. PLoS One 6(9): e25320. Which treatment condition is correlated with a greater stroke volume in rats following myocardial infarction? is question asks us to interpret the given ﬁgure in order to determine which condition is associated with a particular outcome. e MCAT will require us to bring in testable content knowledge, but it will also expect us to know how to use logical reasoning to analyze an experiment.
*$%pass: e ﬁrst step is to think about what the question is asking for us to analyze from within the given passage and ﬁgure. We know from our outside content knowledge that stroke volume is deﬁned as the volume of blood pumped per heartbeat. Simply speaking, all we need to do is to identify what information on the ﬁgure is related to the volume of blood pumped. If we’re not sure how to do this, a good place to start is to look at the units of each graph in the ﬁgure. In a novel ﬁgure, units can serve as a great clue as to what the ﬁgure is about. Since we’re looking for stroke volume, we should be looking for units of volume like liters or cm3. Parts C through F have units of pressure per seconds, pressure, or pressure per volume, which are not what we are looking for. We’ll need to refer to images A and B, both of which have a unit of volume on their x-axes. According to the ﬁgure label, graph A shows the vehicle-treated rat, and graph B shows the atorvastatin-treated rat. e label also tells us that these graphs show pressure-volume cardiac cycle loops of two rats, one in each condition. Now we must relate these graphs to stroke volume. Remember that stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped per heartbeat. In other words, it is the amount of blood pumped aer one cardiac cycle. On a pressure-volume graph, a cardiac cycle is seen here as a rectangular loop, with the height and width of the loop representing the pressure change and volume change, respectively. Looking at the two graphs in the ﬁgure, we must compare the changes in the volume of the loops of the two conditions.
*$%pass: Even without explicitly measuring the dimensions, we can see that the atorvastatin graph has much wider loops, and thus a greater stroke volume. Based on parts A and B of Figure 1, we can reasonably conclude that treatment with atorvastatin is correlated with greater stroke volume in rats post-infarction as compared to the control (vehicle) Arteries carry blood away from the heart. In order to deliver blood to the entire body, the circulatory system utilizes vessels of diﬀerent sizes. e three major types of vessels are arteries, veins, and capillaries. Blood travels away from the heart in arteries, the largest of which is the aorta (in the systemic circulation). Major arteries, such as the common carotids, subclavians, and renal arteries, branch oﬀ of the aorta to distribute the bloodﬂow toward diﬀerent peripheral tissues. Arteries then undergo further divisions and name changes as they divert blood to speciﬁc tissues and organs until, upon reaching their target, they branch into arterioles, which ultimately lead to capillaries that perfuse the tissues. ere is also a set of coronary arteries at the base of the aorta that sends blood to perfuse the heart musculature. On the venous side of a capillary network, the capillaries join together into venules, which join to form veins. Venous blood empties into the superior and inferior venae cavae for entry into the right side of the heart. All blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells. is special type of cell helps to maintain the vessel by releasing chemicals that aid in vasodilation and vasoconstriction. In addition, endothelial cells can allow white blood cells to pass through the vessel wall and into the tissues during an inﬂammatory response.
*$%pass: Finally, endothelial cells release certain chemicals when damaged that are involved in the formation of blood clots to repair the vessel and stop bleeding. A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, is caused by a lack of bloodflow through the coronary arteries, which results in decreased oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle itself. Anaerobic respiration cannot produce enough ATP to keep up with demand, so the muscle tissue begins to die. A person suffering a heart attack is often given a β-blocker, which blocks the sympathetic stimulation of the heart, resulting in lower heart rate and lower contractility. With a β-blocker, the heart does not work as hard, so its oxygen demand is diminished, which helps to prevent further damage to cardiac tissue. Cross sections of the diﬀerent blood vessels are shown in Figure 7.4. Don’t worry about the names of the layers; simply be able to recognize that the same types of cells comprise the diﬀerent vessels and that arteries have much more smooth muscle than veins. Figure 7.4 Structure of Blood Vessels Arteries move blood away from the heart to the lungs and other parts of the body. Most arteries contain oxygenated blood; in fact, only the pulmonary arteries and umbilical arteries contain deoxygenated blood. Smaller, muscular arteries are known as arterioles. Arteries are highly muscular and elastic, creating tremendous resistance to the ﬂow of blood. is is one of the reasons why the le side of the heart must generate much higher pressures: to overcome the resistance caused by systemic arteries. Aer arteries are ﬁlled with blood, the elastic recoil from their walls maintains a high pressure and forces blood forward. Capillaries are vessels with a single endothelial cell layer and are so small that red blood cells must pass through the capillaries in a single-ﬁle line.
*$%pass: e thin wall of the capillary allows easy diﬀusion of gases (O2 and CO2), nutrients (most notably, glucose), and wastes (ammonia and urea, among others). Capillaries are therefore the interface for communication of the circulatory system with the tissues. Remember, too, that blood also carries hormones, so capillaries allow endocrine signals to arrive at their target Capillaries can be quite delicate. When capillaries are damaged, blood can leave the capillaries and enter the interstitial space. If this occurs in a closed space, it results in a bruise. Veins are thin-walled, inelastic vessels that transport blood to the heart. Except for the pulmonary and umbilical veins, all veins carry deoxygenated blood. Venules are smaller venous structures that connect capillaries to the larger veins of the body. e smaller amount of smooth muscle in the walls of veins gives them less recoil than arteries. Furthermore, veins are able to stretch to accommodate larger quantities of blood. Indeed, three-fourths of our total blood volume may be in venous circulation at any one time. Note that, even though the volume of arterial blood is normally much less than the volume of venous blood, the total volume passing through either side of the heart per unit time (cardiac output) is the same. Given that the heart is located in the chest, bloodﬂow in most veins is upward from the lower body back to the heart, against gravity. In the inferior vena cava, this translates into a large amount of blood in a vertical column. e pressure at the bottom of this venous column in the large veins of the legs can be quite high. In fact, it can exceed systolic pressure (120 mmHg), going as high as 200 mmHg or more. us, veins must have structures to push the blood forward and prevent backﬂow.
*$%pass: Larger veins contain valves; as blood ﬂows forward in the veins, the valves open. When blood tries to move backward, the valves will slam shut. Failure of the venous valves can result in the formation of varicose veins, which are distended where blood has pooled. People who are pregnant are especially susceptible to the formation of varicose veins due to an increase in the total blood volume during pregnancy and compression of the inferior vena cava by the fetus. Blood clots may form in the deep veins of the legs as a result of injury, inactivity (blood stasis), or a hypercoagulable state (a tendency for the blood to clot excessively). The clots may dislodge and travel through the right atrium and right ventricle, through the pulmonary artery, and into the lungs. Such clots, called pulmonary emboli (or, more specifically, thromboemboli), block segments of the pulmonary arteries and produce rapid, labored breathing and chest pain. Death may occur if the thromboemboli are large. Many patients may be immobile following a surgical procedure or during a long hospital stay. This introduces the threat of DVT and pulmonary emboli, which are very undesirable complications in someone who is already sick. Thus, in hospitals, special wraps are placed on the legs that contract rhythmically in order to prevent pooling of blood and the formation of blood clots. In addition, many patients receive medications like heparin or warfarin to prevent the formation of clots. In addition to high pressure in the lower extremities, the small amount of smooth muscle also creates a challenge for propelling blood forward. us, the veins must rely on an external force to generate the pressure to push blood toward the heart.
*$%pass: Most veins are surrounded by skeletal muscles, which squeeze the veins as the muscles contract, forcing the blood up against gravity in much the same way that squeezing the bottom of a tube of toothpaste causes the contents to be expelled through the top of the tube. is is why sitting motionless for long periods of time, such as in the cramped middle seat on a long transoceanic ﬂight or aer surgery, can increase the risk of blood clot formation in the veins of the legs and pelvis. Blood pools in the lower extremities, and sluggish blood coagulates more easily. A clot in the deep veins of the leg is called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). is clot may become dislodged and travel through the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it can cause a life-threatening condition called a pulmonary embolus. Circulation is, by deﬁnition, circular. Let’s return to the anatomy of the heart and vasculature, shown in Figure 7.1, to trace the ﬂow of blood through the body. A closeup of bloodﬂow through the heart is also shown in Figure 7.5. Here, we begin with the return of blood to the right atrium. Blood returns to the heart from the body via the venae cavae, which are divided into the superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC). e superior vena cava returns blood from the portions of the body above the heart, while the inferior vena cava returns blood from portions of the body below the heart. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium, travels through the tricuspid valve, and enters the right ventricle.
*$%pass: On contraction, the blood from the right ventricle passes through the pulmonary valve and enters the pulmonary arteries, where it travels to the lungs and breaks up into continuously smaller vessels. Once the blood reaches the capillaries that line the alveoli, it participates in gas exchange, with carbon dioxide leaving the blood and oxygen entering the blood. e blood then travels into pulmonary venules and into the pulmonary veins, which carry the blood to the le side of the heart. Oxygenated blood enters the le atrium, travels through the mitral valve, and enters the le ventricle. On contraction, the blood from the le ventricle passes through the aortic valve and enters the aorta. From the aorta, blood enters arteries, then arterioles, and then capillaries. Aer gas and nutrient exchange occurs at the capillaries, the blood enters the venules, which lead to the larger veins. e veins then empty into either the SVC or IVC for return to the right side of the heart. Figure 7.5 Bloodflow through the Heart While bicuspid valve is an acceptable alternative name for mitral valve, it is rarely used in medicine. Most practitioners will refer to valves by one-letter abbreviations (M for mitral). The name mitral refers to a miter, which is the name for a ceremonial headdress worn by some religious leaders. The two large leaflets of the mitral valve somewhat resemble this Written in shorthand, the pathway appears like this: In most cases, blood will pass through only one capillary bed before returning to the heart. However, there are three portal systems in the body, in which blood will pass through two capillary beds in series before returning to the heart.
*$%pass: In the hepatic portal system, blood leaving capillary beds in the walls of the gut passes through the hepatic portal vein before reaching the capillary beds in the liver. In the hypophyseal portal system, blood leaving capillary beds in the hypothalamus travels to a capillary bed in the anterior pituitary to allow for paracrine secretion of releasing hormones. In the renal portal system, blood leaving the glomerulus travels through an eﬀerent arteriole before surrounding the nephron in a capillary network called the vasa recta.

If all autonomic input to the heart were cut, what would happen? After Chapter 7.2, you will be able to: Recall the components of plasma Predict compatible blood types given a blood type Identify the purpose of hematocrit measurements, as well as the relevant unit of Recognize the different types of leukocytes and their functions Describe how platelets are produced Distinguish between cell types within blood that contain or do not contain a Now that we have examined the pump and the pipes through which blood travels, let’s take a look at this ﬂuid. In the pathology lab, we frequently study the composition of the blood using a centrifuge.
*$%pass: By spinning the blood at a rapid rate, we can separate this complex ﬂuid into its components based on density. By volume, blood is about 55% liquid and 45% cells, as shown in Figure 7.6. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood, an aqueous mixture of nutrients, salts, respiratory gases, hormones, and blood proteins. Plasma can be further reﬁned via the removal of clotting factors into serum. e cellular portion of blood consists of three major categories: erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. All blood cells are formed from hematopoietic stem cells, which originate in the bone Figure 7.6 The Composition of Blood Serum (plural sera) is used in a variety of medical testing procedures such as antibody testing and blood typing. Serum is considered preferable to plasma for many applications due to the lack of clotting factors and fibrinogens. Erythrocytes—Red Blood Cells In the body, oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the peripheral tissues, and carbon dioxide and other wastes (such as hydrogen ions and ammonia) are picked up from the peripheral tissues and delivered to the organs that process this waste: the lungs, liver, and kidneys. e erythrocyte or red blood cell is a specialized cell designed for oxygen transport. Oxygen does not simply dissolve in the cytoplasm of the red blood cell—remember, molecular oxygen is nonpolar and therefore has low solubility in aqueous environments. Rather, each erythrocyte contains about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin, each of which can bind four molecules of oxygen. erefore, each red blood cell can carry approximately 1 billion molecules of Red blood cells are unique in a number of ways, and their modiﬁcations reﬂect the special role they play in the human body. Red blood cells are biconcave, or indented on both sides, which serves a dual purpose.
*$%pass: First, this shape assists them in traveling through tiny capillaries. Second, it increases the cell’s surface area, which increases gas exchange. Red blood cells are also unique in that, when they mature, the nuclei, mitochondria, and other membrane-bound organelles are lost. e loss of organelles makes space for the molecules of hemoglobin. In addition, the loss of mitochondria in particular means that the red blood cell does not consume the oxygen it is carrying before it is delivered to peripheral tissues. In other words, red blood cells do not carry out oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP; rather, they rely entirely on glycolysis for ATP, with lactic acid (arising from fermentation) as the main byproduct. Because red blood cells lack nuclei, they are unable to divide. Erythrocytes can live for 120 days in the bloodstream before cells in the liver and spleen phagocytize senescent (old) red blood cells to recycle them for their parts. In medicine, a complete blood count measures the quantity of each cell type in the blood. For red blood cells, two commonly given measures are the hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin, of course, measures the quantity of hemoglobin in the blood, giving a result in grams per deciliter. Hematocrit is a measure of how much of the blood sample consists of red blood cells, given as a percentage. A normal hemoglobin is considered to be between 13.5 and 17.5 for phenotypical males and between 12.0 and 16.0 for phenotypical females. A normal hematocrit is considered to be between 41 and 53% for males and between 36 and 46% for females. For example, a patient may have a hemoglobin of 13.8 and a hematocrit of 41.2%. Leukocytes—White Blood Cells Leukocytes or white blood cells usually comprise less than 1 percent of total blood volume.
*$%pass: is translates into about 4,500–11,000 leukocytes per microliter of blood, which is a small number relative to the erythrocyte concentration. is number can massively increase under certain conditions when we need more white blood cells, most notably during infection. White blood cells are a crucial part of the immune system, acting as our defenders against pathogens, foreign cells, cancer, and other materials not recognized as self. Let’s brieﬂy discuss ﬁve basic types of leukocytes, which are all categorized into two classes: granulocytes and agranulocytes. e granular leukocytes or granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) are so named because they contain cytoplasmic granules that are visible by microscopy. ese granules contain a variety of compounds that are toxic to invading microbes; these compounds can be released through exocytosis. Granular leukocytes are involved in inﬂammatory reactions, allergies, pus formation, and destruction of bacteria and parasites. e speciﬁc functions of the three granulocytes are discussed in Chapter 8 of MCAT Biology Review. e agranulocytes, which do not contain granules that are released by exocytosis, consist of lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes are important in the speciﬁc immune response, the body’s targeted ﬁght against particular pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Some lymphocytes act as primary responders against an infection, while others function to maintain a long-term memory bank of pathogen recognition. ese cells, in a very real sense, help our body learn from experience and are prepared to mount a fast response upon repeated exposure to familiar pathogens. Many vaccines work by training these cells. rough exposure to a weakened pathogen, or an antigenic protein (a protein that can be recognized by the immune system) of the pathogen, memory cells can be created.
*$%pass: For example, most children in the United States receive the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, which includes a live but weakened strain of the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. When the vaccine is administered, the virus is recognized as foreign and an immune response is activated. During this process, certain immune cells form a memory of the virus; in other words, our body learns to remember the virus and prepares itself to ward oﬀ the virus if it appears again later in life. Lymphocyte maturation takes place in one of three locations. Lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow are referred to as B-cells, and those that mature in the thymus are called T-cells. B-cells are responsible for antibody generation, whereas T-cells kill virally infected cells and activate other immune cells. e details of these two components of the speciﬁc immune response are discussed in Chapter 8 of MCAT Biology Review. e other agranulocytes are monocytes, which phagocytize foreign matter such as bacteria. Most organs of the body contain a collection of these phagocytic cells; once they leave the bloodstream and enter an organ, monocytes are renamed macrophages. Each organ’s macrophage population may have a speciﬁc name, as well. In the central nervous system, for example, they are called microglia; in the skin, they are called Langerhans cells; in bone, they are called osteoclasts. rombocytes or platelets are cell fragments or shards released from cells in bone marrow known as megakaryocytes. eir function is to assist in blood clotting and they are present in high concentrations (150,000–400,000 per microliter of blood). e enzymatic reactions involved in the formation of a clot (the clotting cascade) will be discussed shortly. As mentioned above, all of the cellular elements of blood originate in the bone marrow.
*$%pass: e production of blood cells and platelets is called hematopoiesis, and is triggered by a number of hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. e most notable of these are erythropoietin, which is secreted by the kidney and stimulates mainly red blood cell development, and thrombopoietin, which is secreted by the liver and kidney and stimulates mainly platelet development. e hematopoietic pathways are shown in Figure 7.7. hematopoietic stem cell forms lymphoid and myeloid stem cells; lymphoid forms NK, T-, and B- (plasma) cells; myeloid forms dendritic cell, monocyte (macrophage), neutrophil, eosinophil, mast cell, basophil, platelets, and erythrocytes Figure 7.7 Hematopoiesis Red blood cells express surface proteins called antigens. In general, an antigen is any speciﬁc target (usually a protein) to which the immune system can react. e two major antigen families relevant for blood groups are the ABO antigens and the Rh factor. e ABO system is comprised of three alleles for blood type. In this particular class of erythrocyte cell-surface proteins, the A and B alleles are codominant, which means that a person may express one, both, or none of the ABO antigens. If the A allele (IA or simply A) is present on one chromosome and the B allele (IB or B) is present on the other chromosome, both will be expressed, and the person’s blood type will be AB. e O allele (i or O) is recessive to both the A and B alleles. People with type O blood do not express either variant (A or B antigen) of this protein and have a homozygous recessive genotype. e naming system of blood types is based on the presence or absence of these protein variants. e four blood types are: A, B, AB, and O.
*$%pass: Because the A and B alleles are dominant, the genotypes for A may be IAIA or IAi, while the genotypes for B may be IBIB or There are two different ways of writing the ABO alleles: IA, IB, and i; or A, B, and O. Be comfortable using either system because the MCAT could show one or the other. Because the former system is more common in medical practice, we’ll be using it throughout this e ABO classiﬁcation has important implications for medical practice; it is critical to match blood types for transfusions. It is no exaggeration to say that blood-type matching is a life and death matter, given the severe hemolysis that can result if the donor blood antigen is recognized as foreign by the recipient’s immune system. For example, a person who has type A blood will recognize the type A protein as self but the type B protein as foreign and will make antibodies to types B and AB. Because type O blood cells express neither antigen variant, they will not initiate any immune response, regardless of the recipient’s actual blood type; people with type O blood are therefore considered universal donors because their blood will not cause ABO-related hemolysis in any recipient. However, a recipient who is type O will produce both anti-A and anti-B antibodies and can only receive type O blood. On the other hand, people with type AB blood are considered universal recipients because they can receive blood from all blood types: no blood antigen is foreign to individuals who have AB blood, so no adverse reactions will occur upon transfusion. A more thorough description of each blood type is given in Table 7.1.
*$%pass: Note that whole blood is almost never given in a transfusion; rather, packed red blood cells (with no plasma) are generally given. us, we care only about the donor’s red blood cell antigens (and not the plasma antibodies) when determining whether hemolysis will occur. Can Donate to . . Can Receive from . . . A and B A, B, AB, O A, B, AB, O Table 7.1 ABO Blood Types You are almost guaranteed to see at least one question on blood groups on Test Day. It is critical that you learn how the system works (IA and IB are codominant, i is recessive). Another important point needs to be made here about antibodies. Antibodies are created in response to an antigen, and they speciﬁcally target that antigen. You would not expect to have antibodies to the Ebola virus if you had never been exposed to it. is is true for the Rh factor as well—an individual who is Rh-negative would not have anti-Rh antibodies prior to exposure to Rh-positive blood. Why, then, does an individual lacking the A allele automatically have an anti-A antibody? e reason may lie in the gut: research has demonstrated that E. coli that inhabit the colon may have proteins that match the A and B alleles. is would serve as a source of exposure and would allow one to develop anti-A (or anti-B) antibodies prior to exposure to another person’s blood. is is why ABO compatibility is so important during blood transfusions—giving the wrong ABO blood type would lead to rapid hemolysis. Antigens are the stimuli for B-cells to make antibodies. After exposure of a B-cell to its specific antigen, the cell becomes an antibody-producing factory. The most common blood type in the United States is O+. The least common is AB-.
*$%pass: e Rh factor (so named because it was ﬁrst described in rhesus monkeys) is also a surface protein expressed on red blood cells. Although at one time it was thought to be a single antigen, it has since been found to exist as several variants. When le unmodiﬁed, Rh-positive (Rh+) or Rh-negative (Rh-) refers to the presence or absence of a speciﬁc allele called D. e presence or absence of D can also be indicated with a plus or minus superscript on the ABO blood type (such as O+ or AB-). Rh-positivity follows autosomal dominant inheritance; one positive allele is enough for the protein to be In blood bank pathology, the Rh factor is often referred to as D. Note that while the A, B, and D proteins are the most important for blood typing, dozens of other antigens can (and should) be matched as well, including C, E, Kell, Lewis, Duffy, and others. The more antigens that are correctly matched, the lower the probability of hemolysis. e Rh factor status is particularly important in obstetric medicine. Exposure to at least a small amount of fetal blood during childbirth is inevitable, no matter how good the obstetrician is. If a person who is pregnant is Rh– and the fetus is Rh+, the person will become sensitized to the Rh factor, and the person’s immune system will begin making antibodies against it. is is not a problem for the ﬁrst child; by the time the person starts producing antibodies, the child has already been born. However, any subsequent pregnancy in which the fetus is Rh+ will present a problem because maternal anti-Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the fetal blood cells, resulting in hemolysis of the fetal cells.
*$%pass: is condition is known as erythroblastosis fetalis and can be fatal to the fetus. Today, we can use medicine to prevent this condition. ere is less concern with maternal-fetal ABO mismatching because antibodies against AB antigens are of a class called IgM, which does not readily cross the placenta (unlike anti-Rh IgG antibodies, which can). When a person who is Rh– is pregnant with a first Rh+ fetus, the risk of erythroblastosis fetalis in subsequent Rh-mismatched pregnancies can usually be avoided by giving the Rh– parent Administration of immunoglobulin (which is a type of passive immunization) will absorb the fetus’s Rh+ cells, preventing the production of anti-Rh antibodies by the parent. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 7.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are the components of plasma? 2.

Which cell type(s) in blood contain nuclei? Which do not?
*$%pass: Do not contain nuclei: Physiology of the Cardiovascular System After Chapter 7.3, you will be able to: Predict the impact of changing bloodflow through arteries, capillaries, and veins on blood pressure and heart function Recall the bicarbonate buffer chemical equation, including its catalyzing enzyme Explain how the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve can be shifted to the left or Recall the series of events and compounds in a coagulation cascade Identify the regions of the body associated with different parts of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve: e cardiovascular system transports many compounds, including gases, nutrients, and waste products, to and from the body’s tissues via red blood cells and plasma. Furthermore, it serves an important role in immunity through specialized cells, such as leukocytes, which help the body ﬁght localized or systemic pathogens. Capillaries within the body can dilate and constrict to maintain proper body temperature. In addition, the circulatory system mediates the formation of blood clots to repair damaged vessels. ese functions reﬂect the important jobs of the cardiovascular system, which include maintenance of blood pressure, gas and solute exchange, coagulation, and thermoregulation. Before we can even discuss gas and solute exchange, it is important to recognize that, for the circulatory system to serve its predominant functions, blood pressure must be kept suﬃciently high to propel blood forward. Blood pressure, therefore, provides healthcare professionals with information regarding the health of the circulatory system. In addition, high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a pathological state that may result in damage to the blood vessels and organs. Blood pressure is a measure of the force per unit area exerted on the wall of the blood vessels and is measured with a sphygmomanometer.
*$%pass: Sphygmomanometers measure the gauge pressure in the systemic circulation, which is the pressure above and beyond atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level), as discussed in Chapter 4 of MCAT Physics and Math Review. Blood pressure is expressed as a ratio of the systolic (ventricular contraction) to diastolic (ventricular relaxation) pressures. Pressure gradually drops from the arterial to venous circulation, with the largest drop occurring across the arterioles, as shown in Figure 7.8. Normal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60 and 120/80. Figure 7.8 Mean Arterial Pressure at Different Locations in the Cardiovascular System The largest drop in blood pressure occurs across the arterioles. This is critical because the capillaries are thin-walled and unable to withstand the pressure of the arterial side of the An analogy can be drawn between circulation and an electric circuit. Much like an electromotive force (voltage) drives a current through a given electrical resistance, the pressure gradient across the circulatory system drives cardiac output through a given vascular resistance. is analogy is an important one to remember because the equations of electric circuits can be applied to the cardiovascular system. For example, Ohm’s law (V = IR) can be translated into the following equation for circulation: ΔP = CO × TPR where ΔP is the pressure diﬀerential across the circulation, CO is the cardiac output, and TPR is the total peripheral (vascular) resistance. It is also important to note that arterioles and capillaries act much like resistors in a circuit. When electricity travels through a wire, the wire itself provides an intrinsic level of resistance that limits the ﬂow of electricity through it. Resistance is based on three factors: resistivity, length, and cross- sectional area. Resistivity has no obvious correlate in physiology, but the other two factors certainly do.
*$%pass: e longer a blood vessel is, the more resistance it oﬀers. e larger the cross-sectional area of a blood vessel, the less resistance it oﬀers. In addition, arteries are highly muscular and are able to expand and contract as needed to change vascular resistance and maintain blood pressure. Arterioles can also contract to limit the amount of blood entering a given capillary bed (much like increasing resistance will decrease current ﬂow to a given branch in a circuit). Finally, with the exception of the three portal systems, all systemic capillary beds are in parallel with each other. erefore, opening capillary beds will decrease vascular resistance (like adding another resistor in parallel) and, assuming the body can compensate, increase cardiac output. Vital signs include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. They provide a quick snapshot of a person’s condition at a given moment. High blood pressure may indicate clinical hypertension, anxiety, catecholamineproducing tumors, or stimulant use, while low blood pressure may indicate hemorrhage, a heart attack, sepsis (severe bloodstream infection), or neurological damage. These are very broad differential diagnoses; however, vital signs combined with a quick clinical history provide a way for clinicians to identify the patients that require immediate intervention. Blood pressure is regulated using baroreceptors in the walls of the vasculature. Baroreceptors are specialized neurons that detect changes in the mechanical forces on the walls of the vessel. When the blood pressure is too low, they can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing the blood pressure. In addition, chemoreceptors can sense when the osmolarity of the blood is too high, which could indicate dehydration.
*$%pass: is promotes the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin), a peptide hormone made in the hypothalamus but stored in the posterior pituitary, which increases the reabsorption of water, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure (while also diluting the blood). Low perfusion to the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney stimulates aldosterone release through the renin–angiotensin– aldosterone system; aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium and, by extension, water, thereby increasing the blood volume and pressure. So, what if blood pressure is too high? Neurologically, sympathetic impulses could decrease, permitting relaxation of the vasculature with a concurrent drop in blood pressure. Within the heart, specialized atrial cells are able to secrete a hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). is hormone aids in the loss of salt within the nephron, acting as a natural diuretic with loss of ﬂuid. Interestingly, ANP is a fairly weak diuretic. Some ﬂuid is lost, but it is oen not enough to counter the eﬀects of a high-salt diet on blood pressure. Indeed, the human body has many diﬀerent ways to raise blood pressure, but very few ways to lower it. Gas and Solute Exchange Blood pressure ensures suﬃcient forward ﬂow of blood through the system. However, what happens when the blood reaches the capillaries? Here, oxygen and nutrients diﬀuse out of the blood into tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, urea, and ammonia diﬀuse into the blood. In addition, hormones are secreted into the capillaries, travel with the circulation, and diﬀuse into their target tissue. Ions and ﬂuid must also be returned to the blood to ensure that no area becomes too swollen with ﬂuid. Regardless of the substance being exchanged, there is one fundamental concept to be considered in this process: concentration gradients.
*$%pass: In each case, one side of the capillary wall has a higher concentration of a given substance than the other. is allows for movement of gases and solutes by Oxygen is carried primarily by hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein composed of four cooperative subunits, each of which has a prosthetic heme group that binds to an oxygen molecule. e binding of oxygen occurs at the heme group’s central iron atom, which can undergo changes in its oxidation state. e binding or releasing of oxygen to or from the iron atom in the heme group is an oxidation–reduction reaction. It is also important to note that some oxygen does diﬀuse into the blood and dissolve into the plasma, but this amount is negligible compared to the quantity of oxygen bound to hemoglobin. e level of oxygen in the blood is oen measured as the partial pressure of O2 within the blood, or PaO2. A normal PaO2 is approximately 70–100 mmHg. However, taking this measurement is inconvenient because it involves taking a sample of blood from an artery. By contrast, oxygen saturation—that is, the percentage of hemoglobin molecules carrying oxygen—is easily measured using a ﬁnger probe. A healthy oxygen saturation level is above 97 percent. In the lungs, oxygen diﬀuses into the alveolar capillaries. As the ﬁrst oxygen binds to a heme group, it induces a conformational shi in the shape of hemoglobin from taut to relaxed. is shi increases hemoglobin’s aﬃnity for oxygen, making it easier for subsequent molecules of oxygen to bind to the remaining three unoccupied heme groups. As other heme groups acquire an oxygen molecule, the aﬃnity continues to increase, thus creating a positive feedback-like (spiraling forward) mechanism.
*$%pass: Once all of the hemoglobin subunits are bound to oxygen, the removal of one molecule of oxygen will induce a conformational shi, decreasing the overall aﬃnity for oxygen, and making it easier for the other molecules of oxygen to leave the heme groups. is is again a positive feedback process; as oxygen molecules leave hemoglobin, it becomes progressively easier for more oxygen to be removed. is phenomenon is a form of allosteric regulation referred to as cooperative binding and results in the classic sigmoidal (S-shaped) oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve shown in Figure 7.9. Figure 7.9 Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve Before looking at shis in this curve, let’s make sure we understand what everything means. According to the curve, the blood is 100 percent saturated in the lungs, at a partial pressure of 100 mmHg O2. e tissues are at a lower partial pressure of oxygen, around 40 mmHg during rest; at this lower partial pressure, the hemoglobin is approximately 80 percent saturated. erefore, about 100 - 80 = 20% of the oxygen has been released from the hemoglobin. Where did this oxygen go? Into the tissues, of course. During exercise, the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissues is even lower— around 20 mmHg. At this lower partial pressure, the hemoglobin is approximately 30 percent saturated. erefore, about 100 - 30 = 70% of the oxygen has been released to the tissues. In reality, unloading of oxygen is also facilitated by shis in the hemoglobin curve that occur during exercise, as described later. Delivering oxygen to tissues is only part of the job of transporting respiratory gases; removing carbon dioxide gas (CO2), the primary waste product of cellular respiration, is also important.
*$%pass: Carbon dioxide gas, like oxygen gas, is nonpolar and therefore has low solubility in the aqueous plasma; only a small percentage of the total CO2 being transported in the blood to the lungs will be dissolved in the plasma. Carbon dioxide can be carried by hemoglobin, but hemoglobin has a much lower aﬃnity for carbon dioxide than for oxygen. e vast majority of CO2 exists in the blood as the bicarbonate ion ( ). When CO2 enters a red blood cell, it encounters the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the combination reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid, a weak acid, will dissociate into a proton and the bicarbonate anion. e hydrogen ion (proton) and bicarbonate ion both have high solubilities in water, making them a more eﬀective method of transporting metabolic waste products to the lungs for excretion. Upon reaching the alveolar capillaries in the lungs, the same reactions that led to the formation of the proton and bicarbonate anion can be reversed, allowing us to breathe out carbon dioxide: is chemical reaction is important, not only because it provides an eﬀective means of ridding the body’s tissues of carbon dioxide gas, but also because the concentration of free protons in the blood aﬀects pH; the pH, in turn, can have allosteric eﬀects on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Increased carbon dioxide production will cause a right shi in the bicarbonate buﬀer equation, resulting in increased [H+] (decreased pH). ese protons can bind to hemoglobin, reducing hemoglobin’s aﬃnity for oxygen. is decreased aﬃnity can be seen in the oxyhemoglobin curve as a shi to the right; this is known as the Bohr eﬀect.
*$%pass: Note that the triggers for this right shi (increased PaCO2, increased [H+], decreased pH) are oen associated with oxygen demand; higher rates of cellular metabolism result in increased carbon dioxide production and accumulation of lactic acid, both of which decrease pH. is decreased aﬃnity allows more oxygen to be unloaded at the tissues, as shown in Figure 7.10. Looking at the red and green lines, we see that hemoglobin is nearly 100 percent saturated in the lungs (at a partial pressure of 100 mmHg O2) for both lines. However, the green line is signiﬁcantly lower than the red one when we reach a partial pressure of 20 mmHg O2, around that of exercising muscle. erefore, the right shi represents greater unloading of oxygen into the tissues. Figure 7.10 Shifts in the Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Causes of a right shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve: Exercise is the right thing to do. The following occur during exercise: Increased [H+] (decreased pH) Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, and therefore has a left-shifted curve compared to adult hemoglobin. Other causes of a right shi in the oxyhemoglobin curve include increased temperature and increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), a side product of glycolysis in red blood cells. A le shi, like the blue line in Figure 7.10, may occur due to decreased PaCO2, decreased [H+], increased pH, decreased temperature, and decreased 2,3-BPG. In addition, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher aﬃnity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA). is should make sense because fetal red blood cells must literally pull oxygen oﬀ of maternal hemoglobin and onto fetal hemoglobin. e bicarbonate buﬀer system is also important because it links the respiratory and renal systems. Disturbances in either of these systems can lead to changes in the pH of the blood.
*$%pass: For example, if an individual hyperventilates, excess CO2 will be blown oﬀ, shiing the bicarbonate buﬀer system to the le and decreasing the concentration of protons. is leads to an increase in pH, or what is known as respiratory alkalosis. e kidney can compensate for this change by increasing excretion of bicarbonate, which brings the pH back to normal. In contrast, in renal tubular acidosis type I, the kidney is unable to excrete acid eﬀectively. is leads to a buildup of protons in the blood (metabolic acidosis), which causes the buﬀer system to shi to the le. e excess CO2 formed in the process can be exhaled, and the person may increase respiratory rate to compensate, bringing the pH back to normal. Nutrients, Waste, and Hormones In addition to respiratory gases, blood also carries nutrients, waste products, and hormones to the appropriate location for use or disposal. As discussed earlier, concentration gradients guide much of the movement of these substances to and from the tissues. Carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed into the capillaries of the small intestine and enter the systemic circulation via the hepatic portal system. Fats are absorbed into lacteals in the small intestine, bypassing the hepatic portal circulation to enter systemic circulation via the thoracic duct. When released from intestinal cells, fats are packaged into lipoproteins, which are water-soluble. e absorption of nutrients is covered more extensively in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biology Review. Wastes, such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and urea, enter the bloodstream by traveling down their respective concentration gradients from the tissues to the capillaries. e blood eventually travels to the kidneys, where these waste products are ﬁltered or secreted for elimination from the body. Hormones enter the circulation in or near the organ where the hormone is produced.
*$%pass: is usually occurs by exocytosis, allowing for secretion of hormones into the bloodstream. Certain hormones are carried by proteins in the blood and are released under speciﬁc conditions. Once hormones reach their target tissues, they can activate cell-surface receptors (peptide hormones) or diﬀuse into the cell to activate intracellular or intranuclear receptors (steroid hormones). In the bloodstream, two pressure gradients are essential for maintaining a proper balance of ﬂuid volume and solute concentrations between the blood and the interstitium (the cells surrounding the blood vessels). ese are the opposing but related hydrostatic and osmotic (oncotic) pressures. Hydrostatic pressure is the force per unit area that the blood exerts against the vessel walls. is is generated by the contraction of the heart and the elasticity of the arteries, and can be measured upstream in the large arteries as blood pressure. Hydrostatic pressure pushes ﬂuid out of the bloodstream and into the interstitium through the capillary walls, which are somewhat leaky by design. Osmotic pressure, on the other hand, is the “sucking” pressure generated by solutes as they attempt to draw water into the bloodstream. Because most of this osmotic pressure is attributable to plasma proteins, it is usually called oncotic pressure. At the arteriole end of a capillary bed, hydrostatic pressure (pushing ﬂuid out) is much larger than oncotic pressure (drawing ﬂuid in), and there is a net eﬄux of water from the circulation, as shown in Figure 7.11. As ﬂuid moves out of the vessels, the hydrostatic pressure drops signiﬁcantly, but the osmotic pressure stays about the same. erefore, at the venule end of the capillary bed, hydrostatic pressure (pushing ﬂuid out) has dropped below oncotic pressure (drawing ﬂuid in), and there is a net inﬂux of water back into the circulation.
*$%pass: Figure 7.11 Starling Forces at a Capillary Bed Hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of vessels and is dependent on blood pressure generated by the heart and the elastic arteries. Osmotic pressure pulls fluid back into the vessels and is dependent on the number of particles dissolved in the plasma; most are proteins, so we often refer to this as oncotic pressure. e balance of these opposing pressures, also called Starling forces, is essential for maintaining the proper ﬂuid volumes and solute concentrations inside and outside the vasculature. Imbalance of these pressures can result in too much or too little ﬂuid in the tissues. For example, accumulation of excess ﬂuid in the interstitium results in a condition called edema. We should note that some interstitial ﬂuid is also taken up by the lymphatic system. Most lymphatic ﬂuid (lymph) is returned to the central circulatory system by way of a channel called the thoracic duct. Blockage of lymph nodes by infection or surgery can also result in edema. Although you do not need to learn or memorize the Starling equation, which quantiﬁes the net ﬁltration rate between two ﬂuid compartments, you should understand that the movement of solutes and ﬂuid at the capillary level is governed by pressure diﬀerentials, just like the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the lungs. Certain genetic diseases, such as hemophilia, cause malfunctions in the cascade of clotting reactions and increase the risk of life-threatening blood loss from even relatively minor injuries. Hemophilia A is the most common form and, as a sex-linked trait, is far more common in genotypical males than genotypical females. We have now covered most of the functions of red blood cells and plasma.
*$%pass: We’ve brieﬂy touched on white blood cells, which we’ll explore more extensively in Chapter 8 of MCAT Biology Review. is leaves us with platelets, which protect the vascular system in the event of damage by forming a clot. Clots are composed of both coagulation factors (proteins) and platelets, and they prevent (or at least minimize) blood loss. When the endothelium of a blood vessel is damaged, it exposes the underlying connective tissue, which contains collagen and a protein called tissue factor. When platelets come into contact with exposed collagen, they sense this as evidence of injury. In response, they release their contents and begin to aggregate, or clump together. Simultaneously, coagulation factors, most of which are secreted by the liver, sense tissue factor and initiate a complex activation cascade. While the details of the coagulation cascade are beyond the scope of the MCAT, it is important to know that the endpoint of the cascade is the activation of prothrombin to form thrombin by thromboplastin. rombin can then convert ﬁbrinogen into ﬁbrin. Fibrin ultimately forms small ﬁbers that aggregate and cross-link into a woven structure, like a net, that captures red blood cells and other platelets, forming a stable clot over the area of damage, as shown in Figure 7.12. A clot that forms on a surface vessel that has been cut is called a scab. Figure 7.12 Thrombus (Clot) Formation rombus formation, or blood clotting, occurs when blood vessels are injured. e process begins when platelets attach to the matrix that becomes exposed when the endothelial cells lining blood vessels are disrupted. is attachment then activates quiescent αIIbβ3 integrin molecules, causing them to adhere to circulating proteins—including ﬁbrinogen, which forms bridges to additional platelets.
*$%pass: Together the cells and proteins ultimately form a network of cells and ﬁbers dense enough to plug the injury and prevent blood loss until the wound can be repaired. Ultimately, the clot will have to be broken down. is task is accomplished predominantly by plasmin, which is generated from plasminogen. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 7.3 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. In bacterial sepsis (overwhelming bloodstream infection), a number of capillary beds throughout the body open simultaneously. What effect would this have on the blood pressure? Besides the risk of infection, why might sepsis be dangerous for the heart? 2. What is the chemical equation for the bicarbonate buffer system? What enzyme catalyzes this reaction? 3. Where should you look on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to determine the amount of oxygen that has been delivered to tissues? 4. What direction does the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve shift as a result of exercise? What physiological changes cause this shift and why? 5. Exposure of which subendothelial compounds start the coagulation cascade? What protein helps stabilize the clot? Starts the cascade: Stabilizes the clot: e cardiovascular system is one of the most commonly tested MCAT topics. You should be familiar with its basic structure: a system with two pumps in series. e right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation, while the le ventricle pumps blood into the systemic circulation. We discussed the myogenic activity of cardiac muscle and the pathway that electricity follows in the heart through the SA node, AV node, bundle of His, and Purkinje ﬁbers. e movement of blood through the vascular system is a result of the heart’s pumping to generate pressure.
*$%pass: Blood pressure is a measure of the blood’s force per unit area on the vessel walls and is recorded as a gauge pressure (pressure above and beyond atmospheric pressure). We discussed the diﬀerences in structure between arteries, capillaries, and veins, and how these anatomical diﬀerences are reﬂective of their diﬀerent functions. We then reviewed the composition of blood along with the three major blood cell types. We examined the ABO and Rh antigen systems, which frequently appear on the MCAT due to their widespread clinical relevance. e blood’s ability to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide was also described; recall that carbon dioxide is primarily carried as bicarbonate ions in the blood. e conversion of carbon dioxide to and from this ion is accomplished by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. In this chapter, we focused on the functions of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. We brieﬂy examined the immune system, which is primarily driven by the actions of white blood cells and their products. Immunology is considered one of the most challenging courses in medical school, as you’ll learn about dozens of cytokines, clusters of diﬀerentiation (CD), and specialized cell types. In the next chapter, we’ll focus on the basics of immunology, discussing the major components of the innate (nonspeciﬁc) and adaptive (speciﬁc) immune responses. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Anatomy of the Cardiovascular System e cardiovascular system consists of a muscular four-chambered heart, blood vessels, and blood. e heart is composed of cardiac muscle and supports two diﬀerent circulations: the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. Each side of the heart consists of an atrium and a ventricle.
*$%pass: e atria are separated from the ventricles by the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid on the right, bicuspid [mitral] on the le). e ventricles are separated from the vasculature by the semilunar valves (pulmonary on the right, aortic on the le). e pathway of blood is: right atrium pulmonary artery lungs pulmonary veins le atrium aorta arteries arterioles capillaries venules veins venae cavae right atrium e le side of the heart contains more muscle than the right side because the systemic circulation has a much higher resistance and Electrical conduction of the heart starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node and then goes to the atrioventricular (AV) node. From the AV node, electrical impulses travel to the bundle of His before traveling through the Purkinje ﬁbers. Systole refers to the period during ventricular contraction when the AV valves are closed. During diastole, the heart is relaxed and the semilunar valves are closed. e cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume. e sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate and contractility. e parasympathetic nervous system decreases heart e vasculature consists of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries are thick, highly muscular structures with an elastic quality. is allows for recoil and helps to propel blood forward within the system. Small muscular arteries are arterioles, which control ﬂow into capillary beds. Capillaries have walls that are one cell thick, making them so narrow that red blood cells must travel through them single ﬁle. Capillaries are the sites of gas and solute exchange. Veins are inelastic, thin-walled structures that transport blood to the heart. ey are able to stretch in order to accommodate large volumes of blood but do not have recoil capability. Veins are compressed by surrounding skeletal muscles and have valves to maintain one-way ﬂow. Small veins are called venules.
*$%pass: A portal system is one in which blood passes through two capillary beds in series. In the hepatic portal system, blood travels from the gut capillary beds to the liver capillary bed via the hepatic portal vein. In the hypophyseal portal system, blood travels from the capillary bed in the hypothalamus to the capillary bed in the anterior pituitary. In the renal portal system, blood travels from the glomerulus to the vasa recta through an eﬀerent arteriole. Blood is composed of cells and plasma, an aqueous mixture of nutrients, salts, respiratory gases, hormones, and blood proteins. Erythrocytes (red blood cells) lack mitochondria, a nucleus, and organelles in order to make room for hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen. Common measurements include hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit, the percentage of blood composed of Leukocytes (white blood cells) are formed in the bone marrow. ey are a crucial part of the immune system. Granular leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils play a role in nonspeciﬁc immunity. Agranulocytes, including lymphocytes and monocytes, also play a role in immunity, with lymphocytes playing a large role in speciﬁc rombocytes (platelets) are cell fragments from megakaryocytes that are required for coagulation. Blood antigens include the surface antigens A, B, and O, as well as Rh e IA (A) and IB (B) alleles are codominant, while the i (O) allele is recessive. People have antibodies for any AB alleles they do not have. Positive Rh factor is dominant. An Rh-negative individual will only create anti-Rh antibodies aer exposure to Rh-positive blood. Physiology of the Cardiovascular System Blood pressure refers to the force per unit area that is exerted on the walls of blood vessels by blood.
*$%pass: It is divided into systolic and diastolic It must be high enough to overcome the resistance created by arterioles and capillaries, but low enough to avoid damaging the vasculature and surrounding structures. It can be measured with a sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure is maintained by baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reﬂexes. Low blood pressure promotes aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) release. High blood osmolarity also promotes ADH release. High blood pressure promotes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release. Gas and solute exchange occurs at the level of the capillaries and relies on the existence of concentration gradients to facilitate diﬀusion across the capillary walls. Capillaries are also leaky, which aids in the transport of gases and solutes. Starling forces consist of hydrostatic pressure and osmotic (oncotic) pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure of the ﬂuid within the blood vessel, while osmotic pressure is the “sucking” pressure drawing water toward solutes. Oncotic pressure is osmotic pressure due to proteins. Hydrostatic pressure forces ﬂuid out at the arteriolar end of a capillary bed; oncotic pressure draws it back in at the venule end. Oxygen is carried by hemoglobin, which exhibits cooperative binding. In the lungs, there is a high partial pressure of oxygen, resulting in loading of oxygen onto hemoglobin. In the tissues, there is a low partial pressure of oxygen, resulting in unloading. With cooperative binding, each successive oxygen bound to hemoglobin increases the aﬃnity of the other subunits, while each successive oxygen released decreases the aﬃnity of the other subunits. Carbon dioxide is largely carried in the blood in the form of carbonic acid, or bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. Carbon dioxide is nonpolar and not particularly soluble, while bicarbonate, hydrogen ions, and carbonic acid are polar and highly soluble.
*$%pass: A high PaCO2, high [H+], low pH, high temperature, and high concentration of 2,3-BPG can cause a right shi in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, reﬂecting a decreased aﬃnity In addition to the opposites of the causes of a right shi, a le shi can also be seen in the dissociation curve for fetal hemoglobin compared to adult hemoglobin. Nutrients, wastes, and hormones are carried in the bloodstream to tissues for use or disposal. Coagulation results from an activation cascade. When the endothelial lining of a blood vessel is damaged, the collagen and tissue factor underlying the endothelial cells are exposed. is results in a cascade of events known as the coagulation cascade, ultimately resulting in the formation of a clot over the Platelets bind to the collagen and are stabilized by ﬁbrin, which is activated by thrombin. Clots can be broken down by plasmin. Answers to Concept Checks Valve at Prevents Backﬂow Mitral (bicuspid) valve 2.

If all autonomic innervation to the heart were lost, the heart would continue beating at the intrinsic rate of the pacemaker (SA node). e individual would be unable to modify heart rate via the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system, but the heart would not stop beating. 1.

Opening up more capillary beds (which are in parallel) will decrease the overall resistance of the circuit. e cardiac output will therefore increase in an attempt to maintain constant blood pressure. is is a risk to the heart because the increased demand on the heart can eventually tire it, leading to a heart attack or a precipitous drop in blood pressure. 2. e bicarbonate buﬀer system equation is e combining of carbon dioxide and water is catalyzed by carbonic 3. e amount of oxygen delivery can be seen as a drop in the y-value (percent hemoglobin saturation) on an oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. For example, if the blood is 100% saturated while in the lungs (at 100 mmHg O2) and only 80% saturated while in tissues (at 40 mmHg O2), then 20% of the oxygen has been released to tissues. 4. e oxyhemoglobin curve shis to the right during exercise in response to increased arterial CO2, increased [H+], decreased pH, and increased temperature. is right shi represents hemoglobin’s decreased aﬃnity for oxygen, which allows more oxygen to be unloaded at the tissues. 5.
*$%pass: e coagulation cascade can be started by the exposure of collagen and tissue factor to platelets and coagulation factors. e clot is stabilized by Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are produced in the red bone marrow and circulate in the blood for about 120 days, aer which they are phagocytized in the spleen and the liver, eliminating (D). Red blood cells have a disc-like shape and lose their membranous organelles (like mitochondria and nuclei) during maturation. is makes (C) the correct answer. Erythrocytes are ﬁlled with hemoglobin; their lack of mitochondria makes their metabolism solely anaerobic, eliminating (A) and (B). An ordinary cardiac contraction originates in, and is regulated by, the sinoatrial (SA) node. e impulse travels through both atria, stimulating them to contract simultaneously. e impulse then arrives at the atrioventricular (AV) node, which momentarily slows conduction, allowing for completion of atrial contraction and ventricular ﬁlling. e impulse is then carried by the bundle of His and its branches through the Purkinje ﬁbers in the walls of both ventricles, generating a strong contraction. According to the Bohr eﬀect, decreasing the pH in the blood decreases hemoglobin’s aﬃnity for O2. is makes (C) the correct answer. e aﬃnity is generally lowered in exercising muscle to facilitate unloading of oxygen to tissues, eliminating (A). A decrease in the PaCO2 would cause a decrease in [H+] or increased pH—which increases hemoglobin’s aﬃnity for O2, eliminating (B). Finally, (D) is incorrect because hemoglobin’s aﬃnity for O2 is higher in fetal blood than in Blood drains from the superior and inferior venae cavae into the right atrium. It passes through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, and then through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the lungs.
*$%pass: Oxygenated blood returns to the le atrium via the pulmonary veins. It ﬂows through the mitral valve into the le ventricle. From the le ventricle, it is pumped through the aortic valve into the aorta for distribution throughout the body. e exchange of ﬂuid is greatly inﬂuenced by the diﬀerences in the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of blood and tissues. e osmotic (oncotic) pressure remains relatively constant; however, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end is greater than the hydrostatic pressure at the venous end. As a result, ﬂuid moves out of the capillaries at the arterial end and back in at the venous end. Fluid is reabsorbed at the venous end because the osmotic pressure exceeds the hydrostatic pressure. Proteins should not cross the capillary wall under normal circumstances. e ﬁrst step in solving this problem is to deﬁne cardiac output: cardiac output = heart rate × stroke volume. We can therefore divide the cardiac output by the stroke volume to determine Note that this heart rate is actually pathologically fast; a normal heart rate is considered to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Without knowing a patient’s blood type, the only type of transfusion that we can safely give is O–. People with O– blood are considered universal donors because their blood cells contain no surface antigens. erefore, O– blood can be given to anyone without potentially life- threatening consequences from ABO or Rh incompatibility. e only answer choice that correctly describes arteries and veins is (C); the pressure in the aorta usually ranges between 120 and 80 mmHg, depending on whether the heart is in systole or diastole, whereas the pressure in the superior vena cava is near zero. (A) is incorrect because arteries are thick-walled and veins are thin-walled.
*$%pass: (B) is also incorrect; this relationship is reversed in pulmonary and umbilical circulation. (D) is reversed as well; arteries make use of the pumping of the heart and the “snapping back” of their elastic walls to transport blood, whereas venous blood is propelled along by skeletal muscle contractions. e relative lack of smooth muscle in venous walls allows stretching to store most of the blood in the body. Valves in the veins allow for one-way ﬂow of blood toward the heart, not stretching. Both arteries and veins are close to lymphatic vessels, which has no bearing on their relative diﬀerence in volume. Both arteries and veins have a single-cell endothelial lining. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of metabolism in cells that later combines with water to form bicarbonate in a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. is system is blood plasma’s most important buﬀer system. Food and ﬂuid absorption are not signiﬁcant sources of buﬀering, eliminating (A) and (B). While the kidneys can be involved in acid–base balance, they carry out this function through their ﬁltration, secretion, and reabsorption mechanisms, not through hormone release, eliminating (D). In circulation, plasma proteins play an important role in generating osmotic (oncotic) pressure. is allows water that is displaced at the arterial end of a capillary bed by hydrostatic pressure to be reabsorbed at the venule end. Loss of these plasma proteins would cause a decrease in the plasma osmotic (oncotic) pressure. e atrioventricular valves are located between the atria and the ventricles on both sides of the heart. eir role is to prevent backﬂow of blood into the atria. e valve on the right side of the heart has three cusps and is called the tricuspid valve. It prevents backﬂow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium.
*$%pass: Holding one’s breath for a prolonged period would result in a drop in oxygenation and an increase in PaCO2. e increased carbon dioxide would associate with water to form carbonic acid, which would dissociate into a proton and a bicarbonate anion. Further, the low oxygen saturation would eventually lead to anaerobic metabolism in some tissues, causing an increase in lactic acid. ese would all lead to a decreased pH. e cardiac conduction system starts at the SA node, which is located near the top of the right atrium, and continues down to the AV node, which is located between the two AV valves. e bundle of His is located within the wall between the ventricles, and is likely to be aﬀected if the wall between the ventricles has been damaged by a heart attack. is may aﬀect the le ventricle, but the le ventricular muscle itself is not part of the cardiac conduction system. e greatest amount of resistance is provided by the arterioles. Arterioles are highly muscular and have the ability to contract and dilate in order to regulate blood pressure. Consult your online resources for additional practice.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems Over the past few decades, the public’s imagination has been captured by alarming reports of “ﬂesh-eating” bacteria and diseases. While these bacteria do not actually eat ﬂesh, that doesn’t make them any less dangerous. “Flesh- eating” bacteria cause a condition called necrotizing fasciitis, a serious disease that requires aggressive medical and surgical treatment including intravenous antibiotics, surgical debridement (removal) of the necrotic tissue, and sometimes even amputation. Many diﬀerent types of bacteria, including group A Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens, and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), can cause necrotizing fasciitis. e massive destruction of skin, muscle, and connective tissue by the release of bacterial toxins called superantigens is life-threatening. ese superantigens cause the immune system to become nonspeciﬁcally overactivated. Necrotizing fasciitis is dangerous not only because of the bacteria and subsequent inﬂammatory response, but also because the destruction of skin —a nonspeciﬁc immune defense—leaves the body susceptible to superinfection (infection with another pathogen). In this chapter, we will consider this type of nonspeciﬁc defense, as well as speciﬁc immune defenses.
*$%pass: e human body relies on the interaction between the innate (nonspeciﬁc) and adaptive (speciﬁc) immune systems in order to protect itself from disease. However, the immune system is not always perfect in its responses. Sometimes the immune system may become nonspeciﬁcally overactivated, as is the case with necrotizing fasciitis, or it may become activated against the same human it is supposed to protect. We will discuss the individual parts of the immune system and how these parts work together to protect from disease. In addition, we will discuss the concept of autoimmunity, or disease that results from immune attack against oneself. We’ll brieﬂy touch on vaccines, which take advantage of our understanding of the immune system to protect us from life-threatening infections. e immune system is largely integrated with the lymphatic system, which will be discussed in this chapter as well. Structure of the Immune System After Chapter 8.1, you will be able to: Distinguish between innate and adaptive immunity Draw comparisons between B- and T-cells, including their development, maturation, functions, specificity, and control mechanisms Identify immune cells as granulocytes or agranulocytes Each day, the human body is exposed to numerous bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even parasites. Yet our bodies are able to protect us from infection most of the time. Even when we do get sick, the immune system is usually able to contain and eliminate the infection. The immune system is a topic where cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and biology interact. Thus, it is a topic that allows the MCAT to ask questions that integrate these four topics. As we discuss these complex ideas, focus on the big picture first, creating a mental image to help you put these concepts together. Then go back and plug in the details.
*$%pass: This approach will foster your ability to associate structure with function and to think critically about the topic on Test Day. Innate and Adaptive Immunity In order to ﬁght infection, the human body has two diﬀerent divisions of the immune system: innate and adaptive immunity, compared in Figure 8.1. Innate immunity is composed of defenses that are always active against infection, but lack the ability to target speciﬁc invaders; for this reason, it is also called nonspeciﬁc immunity. Adaptive or speciﬁc immunity refers to the defenses that target a speciﬁc pathogen. is system is slower to act, but can maintain immunological memory of an infection to mount a faster attack in subsequent infections. The mammalian immune system has two overarching divisions. The innate part (left side) acts near entry points into the body and is always at the ready. If it fails to contain a pathogen, the adaptive division (right side) kicks in, mounting a later but highly targeted attack against the specific innate immune system: dendritic cell, monocyte/macrophage, neutrophil; releases cytokines and inﬂammatory proteins. adaptive immune system: B-cell (plasma cell making antibody), T-cell (attacking infected cell) INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM This system includes, among other components, antimicrobial molecules and various phagocytes (cells that ingest and destroy pathogens). These cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, also activate an inflammatory response, secreting proteins called cytokines that trigger an influx of immune cells from the blood. Among the recruits are more phagocytes–notably monocytes (which can mature into macrophages) ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM This system features B-cells and T-cells. Activated B-cells secrete antibody molecules that bind to antigens–specific components unique to a given invader–and destroy the invader directly or mark it for attack by others. T-cells recognize antigens displayed on cells.
*$%pass: Some T-cells help to activate B-cells and other T-cells (not shown); other T-cells directly attack infected cells. T- and B-cells spawn memory cells that promptly eliminate invaders encountered before. Figure 8.1 Divisions of the Immune System e immune system is not housed in a single organ, as shown in Figure 8.2. e structure and components that serve as nonspeciﬁc defenses oen serve functions in other organ systems. e bone marrow produces all of the leukocytes (white blood cells) that participate in the immune system through the process of hematopoiesis, discussed in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biology Review. e spleen is a location of blood storage and activation of B- cells, which turn into plasma cells to produce antibodies as part of adaptive immunity. Note that when B-cells leave the bone marrow, they are considered mature but naïve (because they have not yet been exposed to an antigen). Because these antibodies dissolve and act in the blood (rather than within cells), this division of adaptive immunity is called humoral immunity. T-cells, another class of adaptive immune cells, mature in the thymus, a small gland just in front of the pericardium, the sac that protects the heart. T-cells are the agents of cell-mediated immunity because they coordinate the immune system and directly kill virally infected cells. Finally, lymph nodes, a major component of the lymphatic system, provide a place for immune cells to communicate and mount an attack; B-cells can be activated here as well. Other immune tissue is found in close proximity to the digestive system, which is a site of potential invasion by pathogens. ese tissues are commonly called gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and include the tonsils and adenoids in the head, Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, and lymphoid aggregates in the appendix.
*$%pass: labeled: adenoids, tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, Peyer’s patches (small intestine), lymphatic vessel, appendix, bone Figure 8.2 Anatomy of the Immune and Lymphatic Systems Lay people not involved in medicine often say that their “glands” are swollen when they feel a sensation of fullness around the throat. From a biological standpoint, lymph nodes are not glands—they do not secrete products into the bloodstream (endocrine) or ducts (exocrine). What they are actually experiencing is known medically as lymphadenopathy, or the swelling of the lymph nodes that occurs with activation of the immune system. Organs of the immune system: Lymph nodes filter lymph and are a site where immune responses can be mounted. Bone marrow is the site of immune cell production. The thymus is the site of T-cell maturation. The spleen acts as a storage area for white blood cells and platelets, a recycling center for red blood cells, and a filter of blood and lymph for the immune system. Leukocytes are produced in the bone marrow through hematopoiesis, shown in Figure 8.3. (Note: is is the same image shown in Figure 7.7, but is copied here for convenience.) Leukocytes are divided into two groups of cells: granulocytes and agranulocytes. ese names refer to the presence or absence of granules in the cytoplasm. ese granules contain toxic enzymes and chemicals, which can be released by exocytosis, and are particularly eﬀective against bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. Both granulocytes and agranulocytes come from a common precursor: hematopoietic stem cells. Remember from Chapter 7 of MCAT Biology Review that hematopoietic stem cells are also the cell type that gives rise to red blood cells and platelets. Granulocytes include cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.
*$%pass: e names of these cells actually refer to the way that the cells appear aer staining with certain chemicals. Agranulocytes include the lymphocytes, which are responsible for antibody production, immune system modulation, and targeted killing of infected cells. Monocytes, which are phagocytic cells in the bloodstream, are also considered agranulocytes. ey become macrophages in tissues; many tissues have resident populations of macrophages with speciﬁc names (such as microglia in the central nervous system, Langerhans cells in the skin, and osteoclasts in bone). hematopoietic stem cell forms lymphoid and myeloid stem cells; lymphoid forms NK, T-, and B- (plasma) cells; myeloid forms dendritic cell, monocyte (macrophage), neutrophil, eosinophil, mast cell, basophil, platelets, and erythrocytes Figure 8.3 Hematopoiesis One of the tests often ordered by physicians is known as a complete blood count (CBC). This test counts the number of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. If the CBC is ordered with a differential, it means that each type of white blood cell is counted. Any cell populations that are abnormal may indicate a particular type of infection given the right clinical conditions. For example, if 90 percent of the white blood cells are neutrophils, it is possible that a bacterial infection is present. If 20 percent of the white blood cells are eosinophils, it is possible that an invasive parasitic infection is present. Innate immunity refers to the responses cells can carry out without learning; for this reason, it is also known as the nonspeciﬁc immune response. Conversely, adaptive immunity is developed as immune cells learn to recognize and respond to particular antigens, and is oen aptly referred to as the speciﬁc immune response. We can also divide the speciﬁc immune system into humoral immunity (driven by B-cells and antibodies) and cell- mediated immunity (driven by T-cells).
*$%pass: MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 8.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are the differences between innate and adaptive immunity? 2. Compare and contrast B- and T-cells: Humoral or Cell- 3. Which cells are considered granulocytes? Which are considered agranulocytes? The Innate Immune System After Chapter 8.2, you will be able to: Describe the immunologic functions of each of the noncellular nonspecific immune defenses, including defensins and mucus Identify the immune cell type used for antigen presentation Differentiate between MHC-I and MHC-II Recall the stimuli required for activating natural killer cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells e innate immune system consists of cells and structures that oﬀer Noncellular Nonspecific Defenses Our ﬁrst line of defense is the skin (integument). In Chapter 10 of MCAT Biology Review, we will discuss the speciﬁc homeostatic functions of the skin; for now, we’ll focus on how skin protects the body. e skin provides a physical barrier between the outside world and our internal organs, preventing most bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites from entering the body. Additionally, antibacterial enzymes called defensins can be found on the skin. Sweat also has antimicrobial properties. e skin is an important ﬁrst line of defense: a cut or abrasion on the skin provides an entry point for pathogens into the body. Deeper wounds allow pathogens to penetrate deeper into the body. As discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Biology Review, the respiratory system also has mechanisms to prevent pathogens from entering the body. e respiratory passages are mucous membranes, lined with cilia to trap particulate matter and push it up toward the oropharynx, where it can be swallowed or expelled.
*$%pass: While mucus helps to trap particulates like smoke and dirt, it also helps to prevent bacteria and viruses from gaining access to the lung tissue below. Several other mucous membranes, including those around the eye and in the oral cavity, produce a nonspeciﬁc bacterial enzyme called lysozyme, which is secreted in tears and saliva, respectively. The Gastrointestinal Tract e gastrointestinal tract also plays a role in nonspeciﬁc immunity. First, the stomach secretes acid, resulting in the elimination of most pathogens. In addition, the gut is colonized by bacteria. Most of these bacteria lack the necessary characteristics to cause infection. Because there is already such a large bacterial population in the gut, many potential invaders are not able to compete and are thus kept at bay. Many antibiotics reduce the population of gut ﬂora, providing an opportunity for the growth of pathogens resistant to The GI tract of a newborn baby is particularly susceptible to infection because the newborn’s immune system is underdeveloped and the GI tract is not yet colonized. Breast milk contains a family of antibodies that are particularly effective on mucosal surfaces and help to defend newborn babies against gastrointestinal infections. e complement system consists of a number of proteins in the blood that act as a nonspeciﬁc defense against bacteria. Complement can be activated through a classical pathway (which requires the binding of an antibody to a pathogen) or an alternative pathway (which does not require antibodies). e complement proteins punch holes in the cell walls of bacteria, making them osmotically unstable. Despite the association with antibodies, complement is considered a nonspeciﬁc defense because it cannot be modiﬁed to target a speciﬁc organism over others. To protect against viruses, cells that have been infected with viruses produce interferons, proteins that prevent viral replication and dispersion.
*$%pass: Interferons cause nearby cells to decrease production of both viral and cellular proteins. ey also decrease the permeability of these cells, making it harder for a virus to infect them. In addition, interferons upregulate MHC class I and class II molecules, resulting in increased antigen presentation and better detection of the infected cells by the immune system, as described in the next section. Interferons are responsible for many “ﬂu-like” symptoms that occur during viral infection, including malaise, tiredness, muscle soreness, and fever. Cells of the Innate Immune System So, what happens when bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites breach noncellular defenses? e cells of the innate immune system are always poised and ready to attack. Macrophages, a type of agranulocyte, reside within the tissues. ese cells derive from blood-borne monocytes and can become a resident population within a tissue (becoming a permanent, rather than transient, cell group in the tissue). Many of these resident macrophages are highlighted throughout MCAT Biology Review, including microglia in the central nervous system, Langerhans cells in the skin, and osteoclasts in bone. When a bacterial invader enters a tissue, the macrophages become activated. e activated macrophage does three things. First, it phagocytizes the invader through endocytosis. en, it digests the invader using enzymes. Finally, it presents little pieces of the invader (mostly peptides) to other cells using a protein called major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC binds to a pathogenic peptide (also called an antigen) and carries it to the cell surface, where it can be recognized by cells of the adaptive immune system. In addition, macrophages release cytokines, chemical substances that stimulate inﬂammation and recruit additional immune cells to the area. MHC molecules come in two main classes: class I and class II. All nucleated cells in the body display MHC class I molecules.
*$%pass: Any protein produced within a cell can be loaded onto MHC-I and presented on the surface of the cell, as shown in Figure 8.4. is allows the immune system to monitor the health of these cells and to detect if the cells have been infected with a virus or another intracellular pathogen; only those cells that are infected would be expected to present an unfamiliar (nonself) protein on their surfaces. erefore, the MHC-I pathway is oen called the endogenous pathway because it binds antigens that come from inside the cell. Cells that have been invaded by intracellular pathogens can then be killed by a certain group of T-cells (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) to prevent infection of other cells. virion broken down into antigenic peptides, loaded onto MHC-I in the rough ER, and presented on the cell surface Figure 8.4 Endogenous Pathway for Antigen Presentation (MHC Class I) MHC-I exists in all nucleated cells. MHC molecules are highly variable among humans, but can usually be divided into particular subtypes. People with certain MHC subtypes have different susceptibility to disease, and individuals with certain subtypes are considerably more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. It is also important to match the MHC types of the donor and recipient as closely as possible during transplants to avoid rejection. Major histocompatibility complex molecules are joined with antigens. The MHC–antigen complex then goes to the cell surface to display the antigen. This allows the immune system to monitor the health of cells. MHC-I is in all nucleated cells and presents endogenous antigens. MHC-II is in antigen-presenting cells and presents exogenous antigens. MHC class II molecules are mainly displayed by professional antigen- presenting cells like macrophages, as shown in Figure 8.5. Remember that these phagocytic cells pick up pathogens from the environment, process them, and then present them on MHC-II.
*$%pass: An antigen is a substance (usually a pathogenic protein) that can be targeted by an antibody. While antibody production is the domain of the adaptive immune system, it is important to understand that cells of the innate immune system also present antigens. Because these antigens originated outside the cell, the MHC-II pathway is oen called the exogenous pathway. e presentation of an antigen by an immune cell may result in the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Professional antigen-presenting cells include macrophages, dendritic cells in the skin, some B-cells, and certain activated antigen picked up and broken down, loaded onto MHC-II in the Golgi, brought to cell surface for recognition Figure 8.5 Exogenous Pathway for Antigen Presentation (MHC Class II) MHC-II exists only in professional antigen- presenting cells, like macrophages, dendritic cells, some B- cells, and some activated epithelial cells. Major histocompatibility complex molecules are joined with antigens. The MHC–antigen complex then goes to the cell surface to display the antigen. This allows the immune system to monitor the health of cells. MHC-I is in all nucleated cells and presents endogenous antigens. MHC-II is in antigen-presenting cells and presents exogenous antigens. The innate immune cells are nonspecific and form the first line of defense against This immune defender engulfs and consumes pathogens. This cell releases histamine and other chemicals that promote inflammation. Three cell types with tiny granules in their interiors—neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils —participate in the inflammatory response. It presents antigens—fragments of protein or other molecules from pathogens or cancer cells—to adaptive immune cells, inducing them to attack bearers of the displayed antigens. NATURAL KILLER CELL This cell destroys the body’s own cells that have become infected with pathogens; it also goes after cancer cells.
*$%pass: Macrophages and dendritic cells also have special receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR), the best-described of which are toll- like receptors (TLR). PRRs are able to recognize the category of the invader (bacterium, virus, fungus, or parasite). is allows for the production of appropriate cytokines to recruit the right type of immune cells; each immune cell has diﬀerent weapons that can target particular groups of Natural Killer Cells In the arms race between the human immune system and pathogens, some pathogens have found ways to avoid certain defenses. For example, some viruses cause downregulation of MHC molecules, making it harder for T- cells to recognize the presence of an infection. Natural killer (NK) cells, a type of nonspeciﬁc lymphocyte, are able to detect the downregulation of MHC and induce apoptosis in these virally infected cells. Cancer cells may also downregulate MHC production, so NK cells also oﬀer protection from the growth of cancer as well. In addition to macrophages, the granulocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (and closely related mast cells), are also involved in nonspeciﬁc defense. Neutrophils are the most populous leukocyte in blood and are very short lived (a bit more than ﬁve days). ese cells are phagocytic, like macrophages, and target bacteria. Neutrophils can follow bacteria using chemotaxis—the movement of an organism according to chemical stimuli; in this case, the neutrophil senses products given oﬀ by bacteria, moving up the concentration gradient to the source. Neutrophils can also detect bacteria once they have been opsonized (marked with an antibody from a B-cell). Other cells, like natural killer cells, macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils, also contain receptors for antibodies and can attack opsonized bacteria. Dead neutrophil collections are responsible for the formation of pus during an infection.
*$%pass: Eosinophils contain bright red-orange granules and are primarily involved in allergic reactions and invasive parasitic infections. Upon activation, eosinophils release large amounts of histamine, an inﬂammatory mediator. is results in vasodilation and increased leakiness of the blood vessels, allowing additional immune cells (especially macrophages and neutrophils) to move out of the bloodstream and into the tissue. Inﬂammation is particularly useful against extracellular pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, Histamine causes inflammation by inducing vasodilation and the movement of fluid and cells from the bloodstream into tissues. Finally, basophils contain large purple granules and are involved in allergic responses. ey are the least populous leukocyte in the bloodstream under normal conditions. Mast cells are closely related to basophils, but have smaller granules and exist in the tissues, mucosa, and epithelium. Both basophils and mast cells release large amounts of histamine in response to allergens, leading to inﬂammatory responses. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 8.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. For each of the noncellular nonspecific immune defenses listed below, provide a brief description of its immunologic function: Normal gastrointestinal flora: 2. Which cells are professional antigen-presenting cells? 3. What are the differences between MHC-I and MHC-II? 4. What stimulus activates each of the following types of cells?
*$%pass: Natural killer cells: Basophils and mast cells: The Adaptive Immune System After Chapter 8.3, you will be able to: Recall the major classes of lymphocytes and their functions Describe the three main effects that circulating antibodies can have on a Describe the effects of positive and negative selection on T-cell maturation Explain why the secondary response to a pathogen is more efficient than the Differentiate between passive and active immunity Explain how antibodies become specific for a given antigen e adaptive immune system can identify speciﬁc invaders and mount an attack against that pathogen. e response is variable and depends on the identity of the pathogen. e adaptive immune system can be divided into two divisions: humoral immunity and cell-mediated (cytotoxic) immunity. Each involves the identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc pathogen and organization of an appropriate immune response. Cells of the Adaptive Immune System e adaptive immune system consists mainly of two types of lymphocytes, B-cells and T-cells. B-cells govern the humoral response, while T-cells mount the cell-mediated response. All cells of the immune system are created in the bone marrow, but B- and T-cells mature in diﬀerent locations. B-cells mature in the bone marrow and spleen (although the B in their name originally stood for the bursa of Fabricius, an organ found in birds), and T- cells mature in the thymus. When we are exposed to a pathogen, it may take a few days for the physical symptoms to be relieved. is occurs because the adaptive immune response takes time to form speciﬁc defenses against the B-cells mature in the bone marrow. T-cells mature in the thymus. Humoral immunity, which involves the production of antibodies, may take as long as a week to become fully eﬀective aer initial infection. ese antibodies are speciﬁc to the antigens of the invading microbe.
*$%pass: Antibodies are produced by B-cells, which are lymphocytes that originate and mature in the bone marrow and are activated in the spleen and lymph nodes. The adaptive immune cells target invaders with greater specificity, but respond slower since they are replicated in response to an antigen. Antigens stimulate this cell to divide and produce antibodies that neutralize invaders or tag them for killing. A killer T-cell destroys an infected cell in which it detects the presence of antigens. Other T- cells—such as helper and regulatory types—coordinate the immune response. Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins [Ig]) can carry out many diﬀerent jobs in the body. Just as antigens can be displayed on the surface of cells or can ﬂoat freely in blood, chyle (lymphatic ﬂuid), or air, so too can antibodies be present on the surface of a cell or secreted into body ﬂuids. When an antibody binds to an antigen, the response will depend on the location. For antibodies secreted into body ﬂuids, there are three main possibilities: ﬁrst, once bound to a speciﬁc antigen, antibodies may attract other leukocytes to phagocytize those antigens immediately. is is called opsonization, as described earlier. Second, antibodies may cause pathogens to clump together or agglutinate, forming large insoluble complexes that can be phagocytized. ird, antibodies can block the ability of a pathogen to invade tissues, essentially neutralizing it. For cell-surface antibodies, the binding of antigen to a B-cell causes activation of that cell, resulting in its proliferation and formation of plasma and memory cells, as described later in this chapter. In contrast, when antigen binds to antibodies on the surface of a mast cell, it causes degranulation (exocytosis of granule contents), releasing histamine and causing an inﬂammatory allergic reaction.
*$%pass: Antibodies are Y-shaped molecules that are made up of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, as shown in Figure 8.6. Disulﬁde linkages and noncovalent interactions hold the heavy and light chains together. Each antibody has an antigen-binding region at the end of which is called the variable region (domain), at the tips of the Y. Within this region, there are speciﬁc polypeptide sequences that will bind one, and only one, speciﬁc antigenic sequence. Part of the reason it takes so long to initiate the antibody response is that each B-cell undergoes hypermutation of its antigen-binding region, trying to ﬁnd the best match for the antigen. Only those B-cells that can bind the antigen with high aﬃnity survive, providing a mechanism for generating speciﬁcity called clonal selection. e remaining part of the antibody molecule is known as the constant region (domain). It is this region that cells such as natural killer cells, macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils have receptors for, and that can initiate the complement cascade. Each B-cell makes only one type of antibody, but we have many B- cells, so our immune system can recognize many antigens. Further, antibodies come in ﬁve diﬀerent isotypes (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA). While the speciﬁc purposes of each antibody isotype is outside the scope of the MCAT, you should know that the diﬀerent types can be used at diﬀerent times during the adaptive immune response, for diﬀerent types of pathogens, or in diﬀerent locations in the body. Cells can change which isotype of antibody they produce when stimulated by speciﬁc cytokines in a process called isotype switching.
*$%pass: heavy chain: constant, joining, diversity, and variable regions; light chain: constant, joining, and variable regions; linked by Figure 8.6 Structure of an Antibody Molecule Not all B-cells that are generated actively or constantly produce antibodies. Antibody production is an energetically expensive process, and there is no reason to expend energy to produce antibodies that are not needed. Instead, naïve B-cells (those that have not yet been exposed to an antigen) wait in the lymph nodes for their particular antigen to come along. Upon exposure to the correct antigen, a B-cell will proliferate and produce two types of daughter cells. Plasma cells produce large amounts of antibodies, whereas memory B-cells stay in the lymph node, awaiting reexposure to the same antigen. is initial activation takes approximately seven to ten days and is known as the primary response. e plasma cells will eventually die, but the memory cells may last the lifetime of the organism. If the same microbe is ever encountered again, the memory cells rapidly proliferate and diﬀerentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies speciﬁc to that pathogen. is immune response, called the secondary response, will be more rapid and robust. e development of these lasting memory cells is the basis of the eﬃcacy of vaccination. Whereas humoral immunity is based on the activity of B-cells, cell-mediated immunity involves the T-cells. T-cells mature in the thymus, where they undergo both positive and negative selection. Positive selection refers to allowing only the maturation of cells that can respond to the presentation of antigen on MHC (cells that cannot respond to MHC undergo apoptosis because they will not be able to respond in the periphery). Negative selection refers to causing apoptosis in cells that are self-reactive (activated by proteins produced by the organism itself).
*$%pass: e maturation of T-cells is facilitated by thymosin, a peptide hormone secreted by thymic cells. Once the T-cell has le the thymus, it is mature but naïve. Upon exposure to antigen, T-cells will also undergo clonal selection so that only those with the highest aﬃnity for a given antigen proliferate. “CD” in immunology stands for cluster of differentiation and includes cell-surface markers that can be detected by the lab technique called flow cytometry; these markers give an indication of the types of leukocytes under investigation, how many are present, and their state of maturity. ere are three major types of T-cells: helper T-cells, suppressor T-cells, and killer (cytotoxic) T-cells. Helper T-cells (Th), also called CD4+ T-cells, coordinate the immune response by secreting chemicals known as lymphokines. ese molecules are capable of recruiting other immune cells (such as plasma cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and macrophages) and increasing their activity. e loss of these cells, as occurs in human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection, prevents the immune system from mounting an adequate response to infection; in advanced HIV infection, also called acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS), even weak pathogens can cause devastating consequences as opportunistic infections. CD4+ T-cells respond to antigens presented on MHC-II molecules. Because MHC-II presents exogenous antigens, CD4+ T-cells are most eﬀective against bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections. CD4+ T-cells are better at fighting extracellular infections, while CD8+ T-cells are better at targeting intracellular infections. Cytotoxic T-cells (Tc or CTL, for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), also called CD8+ T-cells, are capable of directly killing virally infected cells by injecting toxic chemicals that promote apoptosis into the infected cell. CD8+ T-cells respond to antigens presented on MHC-I molecules. Because MHC-I presents endogenous antigens, CD8+ T-cells are most eﬀective against viral (and intracellular bacterial or fungal) infections.
*$%pass: CD × MHC = 8 CD4+ cells respond to MHC-II (4 × 2 = 8) CD8+ cells respond to MHC-I (8 × 1 = 8) Suppressor or regulatory T-cells (Treg) also express CD4, but can be diﬀerentiated from helper T-cells because they also express a protein called Foxp3. ese cells help to tone down the immune response once infection has been adequately contained. ese cells also turn oﬀ self-reactive lymphocytes to prevent autoimmune diseases: this is termed self-tolerance. Finally, memory T-cells can be generated. Similar to memory B-cells, these cells lie in wait until the next exposure to the same antigen. When activated, they carry out a more robust and rapid response. Many suppressor T-cells were formerly self-reactive T-cells that have been turned off. When a suppressor T-cell inactivates another lymphocyte, it can either target it for destruction or promote its conversion into another suppressor T-cell. A summary of the diﬀerent types of lymphocytes in adaptive (speciﬁc) immunity is shown in Figure 8.7. T-lymphocytes (cell-mediated immunity): memory, cytotoxic, suppressor, helper; B-lymphocytes (humoral immunity): memory, plasma (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, IgA) Figure 8.7 Lymphocytes of Specific Immunity This diagram shows the differentiation of lymphocyte precursors and the cell types involved in specific immunity. Activation of the Adaptive Immune System It is important to note that the innate and adaptive immune systems are not really disparate entities that function separately. e proper functioning of the entire immune system depends on the interactions between these two systems. ere are ﬁve types of infectious pathogens: bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites (including protozoa, worms, and insects), and prions (for which there are no immune defenses). While the immune system’s response depends on the speciﬁc identity of the pathogen, we present two classic examples: a bacterial (extracellular pathogen) infection and a viral (intracellular pathogen) infection.
*$%pass: Keep in mind that this categorization is imperfect; for example, some bacteria, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes, are actually intracellular pathogens. Bacterial (Extracellular Pathogen) Infections Macrophages are like the sentinels of the human body, always on the lookout for potential invaders. Let’s say a person suﬀers a laceration and bacteria are introduced into the body via this laceration. First, macrophages (and other antigen-presenting cells) engulf the bacteria and subsequently release inﬂammatory mediators. ese cells also digest the bacteria and present antigens from the pathogen on their surfaces in conjunction with MHC-II. e cytokines attract inﬂammatory cells, including neutrophils and additional macrophages. Mast cells are activated by the inﬂammation and degranulate, resulting in histamine release and increased leakiness of the capillaries. is augments the ability of the immune cells to leave the bloodstream to travel to the aﬀected tissue. e dendritic cell then leaves the aﬀected tissue and travels to the nearest lymph node, where it presents the antigen to B-cells. B-cells that produce the correct antibody proliferate through clonal selection to create plasma cells and memory cells. Antibodies then travel through the bloodstream to the aﬀected tissue, where they tag the bacteria for destruction. At the same time, dendritic cells are also presenting the antigen to T-cells, activating a T-cell response. In particular, CD4+ T-cells are activated. ese cells come in two types, called Th1 and Th2. Th1 cells release interferon gamma (IFN-γ), which activates macrophages and increases their ability to kill bacteria. Th2 cells help activate B-cells and are more common in Aer the pathogen has been eliminated, plasma cells die, but memory B- and T-cells remain. ese memory cells allow for a much faster secondary response upon exposure to the pathogen at a later time.
*$%pass: Viral (Intracellular Pathogen) Infections In a viral infection, the virally infected cell will begin to produce interferons, which reduce the permeability of nearby cells (decreasing the ability of the virus to infect these cells), reduce the rate of transcription and translation in these cells (decreasing the ability of the virus to multiply), and cause systemic symptoms (malaise, muscle aching, fever, and so on). ese infected cells also present intracellular proteins on their surface in conjunction with MHC-I; in a virally infected cell, at least some of these intracellular proteins will be viral proteins. CD8+ T-cells will recognize the MHC-I and antigen complex as foreign and will inject toxins into the cell to promote apoptosis. In this way, the infection can be shut down before it is able to spread to nearby cells. In the event that the virus downregulates the production and presentation of MHC-I molecules, natural killer cells will recognize the absence of MHC-I and will accordingly cause apoptosis of these cells. Again, once the pathogen has been cleared, memory T-cells will be generated that can allow a much faster response to be mounted upon a Recognition of Self and Nonself Self-antigens are the proteins and carbohydrates present on the surface of every cell of the body. Under normal circumstances, these self-antigens signal to immune cells that the cell is not foreign and should not be attacked. However, when the immune system fails to make the distinction between self and foreign, it may attack cells expressing particular self-antigens, a condition known as autoimmunity. Note that autoimmunity is only one potential problem with immune functioning: another problem arises when the immune system misidentiﬁes a foreign antigen as dangerous when, in fact, it is not.
*$%pass: Pet dander, pollen, and peanuts are not inherently threatening to human life, yet some people’s immune systems are hypersensitive to these antigens and become overactivated when these antigens are encountered. is is called an allergic reaction. Allergies and autoimmunity are part of a family of immune reactions classiﬁed as hypersensitivity reactions. Autoimmune diseases can result in destruction of tissues, which may cause various deficiencies. Type I diabetes mellitus results from autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas. This results in an inability to produce insulin, characterized by high blood sugars and excessive utilization of fats and proteins for energy. Other examples of autoimmune diseases include multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. e human body strives to prevent autoimmune reactions very early in T- cell and B-cell maturation processes. T-cells are educated in the thymus. Part of this education involves the elimination of T-cells that respond to self- antigens, called negative selection. Immature B-cells that respond to self- antigens are eliminated before they leave the bone marrow. However, this process is not perfect, and occasionally a cell that responds to self-antigens is allowed to survive. Most autoimmune diseases can be treated with a number of therapies; one common example is administration of glucocorticoids (modiﬁed versions of cortisol), which have potent immunosuppressive Oen, diseases can have signiﬁcant, long-term consequences. Infection with the poliovirus, for example, can cause permanent paralysis. Polio used to be a widespread illness; however, today we hardly hear about outbreaks of polio because of a highly eﬀective vaccination program that led to the elimination of polio from many parts of the world. Immunization can be achieved in an active or passive fashion. In active immunity, the immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies against a speciﬁc pathogen.
*$%pass: e means by which we are exposed to this pathogen may either be natural or artiﬁcial. rough natural exposure, antibodies are generated by B-cells once an individual becomes infected. Artiﬁcial exposure (through vaccines) also results in the production of antibodies; however, the individual never experiences true infection. Instead, the individual receives an injection or intranasal spray containing an antigen that will activate B-cells to produce antibodies to ﬁght the speciﬁc infection. e antigen may be a weakened or killed form of the microbe, or it may be a part of the microbe’s protein structure. In 1998, a paper published in The Lancet claimed to have found a link between vaccines and autism. This paper was withdrawn from The Lancet after it was demonstrated that the primary author had an undisclosed conflict of interest and that the results were scientifically inaccurate. In fact, no well-designed scientific study has yet shown this link to exist. Nevertheless, reporting of this unsubstantiated connection in the lay media has influenced some parents and guardians to avoid immunizing their children. Since 1998, outbreaks of measles and mumps in the United States and other industrialized nations have raised concerns about the resurgence of illnesses that were previously thought to have been eliminated from these countries. Vaccines do carry risks, including rare cases of encephalitis (brain inflammation) and Guillain–Barré syndrome (an autoimmune disease in which the myelin of peripheral nerves is attacked), but so too do the pathogens these vaccines protect against. Immunization may also be achieved passively. Passive immunity results from the transfer of antibodies to an individual. e immunity is transient because only the antibodies, and not the plasma cells that produce them, are given to the individual.
*$%pass: Natural examples are the transfer of antibodies across the placenta during pregnancy to protect the fetus and the transfer of antibodies from a mother to her nursing infant through breast milk. In some cases of exposure, such as to the rabies virus or tetanus, intravenous immunoglobulin may be given to prevent the pathogen from spreading. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking The development of immune-mediated liver failure during viral hepatitis has recently been linked to the action of CD8+ T-cells. Several effector mechanisms have been identified in preclinical models, including the cytokines interferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as apoptosis-inducing molecules such as Fas Ligand (FasL) and perforin-1 (Prf1). To better study these factors, a mouse model of acute hepatitis was developed by immunizing mice with OVA epitope (a short peptide sequence derived from the protein ovalbumin) and then infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing OVA peptide 30 days later. Acute liver damage was observed, marked by an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (sALT), a marker of liver damage, and a decrease in body Topic: CD8+ T-cells and hepatitis These are all components of the immune system that may lead to immune-mediated liver failure New model to study immune- mediated liver damage during Damage to liver = elevated sALT, decrease in body weight To study the contribution of FasL and TNF to liver pathology, mice were injected with Anti-FasL, anti-TNF, or IgG control antibodies before adenovirus challenge. Researchers measured sALT levels and body weight in the days post challenge (Figure 1).
*$%pass: To better elucidate the role of perforin-1, OVA-specific T-cells (OT-1 cells) with either WT perforin or perforin-1 KO (OT-1 x Prf1-/- cells), were injected into naive mice prior to Exp 1: test FasL and TNF contribution, antibodies added that will prevent factors from exerting their normal biological function Exp 2: test role of perforin-1, add T-cells with and without perforin- 1, measure sALT and body mass adenovirus challenge. Serum ALT and weight measurements were taken following infection (Figure 2). Figure 1 = antibody study IV: antibody treatment DVs: sALT levels and % loss of Trend: in both graphs, the three groups have overlapping error Figure 2 = cell transfer study IV: presence or absence of DVs: same as previous Trends: mice given perforin-1 knockout cells have no increase in sALT and lose less weight compared to controls Adapted from Welz, M., Eickhoﬀ, S., Abdullah, Z., Trebicka, J., Gartlan, K. H., Spicer, J. A., & Kastenmüller, W. (2018). Perforin inhibition protects from lethal endothelial damage during fulminant viral hepatitis. Nature Communications, 9(1), 4805. Based on the results, which of the three parameters tested, FAS Ligand, Tumor Necrosis Factor, or Perforin, is most likely involved in the destruction of liver tissue during acute infection? is question is really testing our understanding of the experimental design and comprehension of the results. Let’s start with the experimental design. Paragraph 1 tells us that there are four main factors that are believed to be involved in immune-mediated liver damage: FasL, TNF, perforin-1, and INF. To test the involvement of these factors, the researchers designed a new experimental model. ey ﬁrst injected mice with OVA peptide to induce a primary immune response and the development of memory cells. irty days later, the researchers infected the mice with adenovirus expressing OVA.
*$%pass: is will result in activation of memory cells and a secondary immune response, which the researchers showed was able to induce immune-controlled liver damage. In the ﬁrst experiment, the mice were injected with antibodies against FasL and TNF prior to adenovirus infection. ese antibodies will bind to FasL and TNF, rendering them unable to function, similar to knocking out the gene (but signiﬁcantly cheaper than developing transgenic mice!). Figure 1 shows the results. We notice that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in sALT levels nor body weight loss between mice treated with the control antibody and mice treated with either FasL or TNF antibody. We see the same increase in sALT and the same decrease in weight loss, indicating that removing TNF and FasL function did not prevent liver damage. is suggests that these two factors are not required for the immune- mediated liver damage. In the second experiment, we test the involvement of perforin-1. e experimental setup is slightly diﬀerent. Instead of injecting OVA peptide, OVA speciﬁc T-cells were injected into mice. Two diﬀerent types of cells were used, normal and perforin-1 knockout. e mice were then infected with adenovirus as before. is enables us to examine the contribution of perforin-1 in liver damage. Figure 2 shows the results of the experiment. We can note that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in sALT levels between control and perforin-1 knockout (KO) cells. ere is no elevation in sALT in the knockout cells, whereas there is an increase in control cells. is suggests that perforin-1 contributes to liver damage. Furthermore, mice given perforin-1 KO cells lose less weight compared to mice given control cells. Because a knockout of the perforin-1 gene led to a decrease in immune-mediated liver damage in mice, perforin-1 plays an important role in immune-mediated liver damage.
*$%pass: Because the results show no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the control and TNF and FasL antibody treated mice, TNF and FasL do not play a role in immune-mediated liver damage. However, a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between control and perforin-1 knockout cells was observed, indicating a role for perforin-1 in immune-mediated liver damage.

Which cells account for the fact that the secondary response to a pathogen is much more rapid and robust than the primary response? 6. What is the difference between active and passive immunity? The Lymphatic System After Chapter 8.4, you will be able to: Predict how a blockage of flow from a lymph node would impact the lymphatic system and the body as a whole Describe the factors and structures linking lymphatic and cardiovascular e immune system and the lymphatic system are intimately related. B-cells proliferate and develop within the lymphatic system, especially the lymph nodes. is system also serves other functions for the body. e lymphatic system, along with the cardiovascular system, is a type of circulatory system. It is made up of one-way vessels that become larger as they move toward the center of the body. ese vessels carry lymphatic ﬂuid (lymph) and most join to form a large thoracic duct in the posterior chest, which then delivers the ﬂuid into the le subclavian vein (near the heart).
*$%pass: Certain cancers, especially breast cancer, are prone to spread via lymphatic channels. Mastectomy, a surgery that removes the breast, is one of the treatments for breast cancer. In order to ensure that all of the cancer has been removed, local lymph nodes are often removed at the same time. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures along the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes contain a lymphatic channel, as well as an artery and a vein. e lymph nodes provide a space for the cells of the immune system to be exposed to possible pathogens. e lymphatic system serves many diﬀerent purposes for the body by providing a secondary system for circulation. Equalization of Fluid Distribution At the capillaries, ﬂuid leaves the bloodstream and goes into the tissues. e quantity of ﬂuid that leaves the tissues at the arterial end of the capillary bed depends on both hydrostatic and oncotic pressures (Starling forces). Remember that the oncotic pressure of the blood draws water back into the vessel at the venule end, once hydrostatic pressure has decreased. Because the net pressure drawing ﬂuid in at the venule end is slightly less than the net pressure pushing ﬂuid out at the arterial end, a small amount of ﬂuid remains in the tissues. Lymphatic vessels drain these tissues and subsequently return the ﬂuid to the bloodstream. e lymphatics oﬀer some protection against pathology. For example, if the blood has a low concentration of albumin (a key plasma protein), the oncotic pressure of the blood is decreased, and less water is driven back into the bloodstream at the venule end. us, this ﬂuid will collect in the tissues. Provided that the lymphatic channels are not blocked, much of this ﬂuid may eventually return to the bloodstream via the lymphatics.
*$%pass: Only when the lymphatics are overwhelmed does edema occur—swelling due to ﬂuid collecting in tissue. Transportation of Biomolecules e lymphatic system also transports fats from the digestive system into the bloodstream. Lacteals, small lymphatic vessels, are located at the center of each villus in the small intestine. Fats, packaged into chylomicrons by intestinal mucosal cells, enter the lacteal for transport. Lymphatic ﬂuid carrying many chylomicrons takes on a milky white appearance and is called As stated previously in this chapter, lymph nodes are a place for antigen- presenting cells and lymphocytes to interact. B-cells proliferate and mature in the lymph nodes in collections called germinal centers. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 8.4 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. Filariasis is the name for an infection with a member of a certain group of parasites, most notably Wuchereria bancrofti. This parasite resides in lymph nodes and causes blockage of flow. If an individual had a W. bancrofti infection in the lymph nodes of the thigh, what would likely happen? 2. What structure is primarily responsible for returning materials from lymphatic circulation to the cardiovascular system? e ability to fend oﬀ microbial invasion is critical to our survival. e immune system is throughout the body and involves multiple diﬀerent organs and cell types. Nonspeciﬁc mechanisms, such as intact skin, mucous membranes, defensins, lysozyme, complement, interferons, natural killer cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes/macrophages, constitute a complex ﬁrst line of defense; these mechanisms comprise the innate immune system, which is capable of an immediate response but cannot target a speciﬁc pathogen or maintain immunologic memory. e adaptive immune system, comprised of B- and T-cells (lymphocytes), allows our immune system to target speciﬁc pathogens and learn from past exposure.
*$%pass: us, once we are infected with a certain strain of virus, activation of speciﬁc immunity confers long-term protection against that particular virus. We take advantage of this secondary response through immunization, and we can see the problems speciﬁcity can have when a self-antigen is labeled as foreign, leading to autoimmune disease. If the immune system is focused on destroying pathogens, including bacteria, then it’s an interesting transition we make in the next chapter. We’re going from a “sterilization” system to one in which bacterial colonization is the norm. From oral ﬂora to the normal gut bacteria, our ability to digest and absorb nutrients is intimately linked to symbiotic bacteria throughout the digestive tract. In the next chapter, we will explore the anatomy and physiology of the digestive system, which provides us with the raw materials to generate energy, build proteins, and carry out activities of daily living. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Structure of the Immune System e immune system can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is composed of defenses that are always active, but that cannot target a speciﬁc invader and cannot maintain immunologic memory; also called nonspeciﬁc immunity. Adaptive immunity is composed of defenses that take time to activate, but that target a speciﬁc invader and can maintain immunologic memory; also called speciﬁc immunity. e immune system is dispersed in the body. Immune cells come from the bone marrow. e spleen and lymph nodes are sites where immune responses can be mounted, and in which B-cells are activated. e thymus is the site of T-cell maturation. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) includes the tonsils and Leukocytes, or white blood cells, are involved in immune defenses.
*$%pass: The Innate Immune System Many of the nonspeciﬁc defenses are noncellular. e skin acts as a physical barrier and secretes antimicrobial compounds, like defensins. Mucus on mucous membranes traps pathogens; in the respiratory system, the mucus is propelled upward by cilia and can be swallowed Tears and saliva contain lysozyme, an antibacterial compound. e stomach produces acid, killing most pathogens. Colonization of the gut helps prevent overgrowth by pathogenic bacteria through e complement system can punch holes in the cell walls of bacteria, making them osmotically unstable. Interferons are given oﬀ by virally infected cells and help prevent viral replication and dispersion to nearby cells. Many of the nonspeciﬁc defenses are also cellular. Macrophages ingest pathogens and present them on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. ey also secrete MHC class I (MHC-I) is present in all nucleated cells and displays endogenous antigen (proteins from within the cell) to cytotoxic T- cells (CD8+ cells). MHC class II (MHC-II) is present in professional antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, some B-cells, and certain activated epithelial cells) and displays exogenous antigen (proteins from outside the cell) to helper T-cells (CD4+ cells). Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells in the skin. Natural killer cells attack cells not presenting MHC molecules, including virally infected cells and cancer cells. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Neutrophils ingest bacteria, particularly opsonized bacteria (those marked with antibodies). ey can follow bacteria using chemotaxis. Eosinophils are used in allergic reactions and invasive parasitic infections. ey release histamine, causing an inﬂammatory Basophils are used in allergic reactions. Mast cells are related cells found in the skin. The Adaptive Immune System Humoral immunity is centered on antibody production by plasma cells, which are activated B-cells. Antibodies target a particular antigen. ey contain two heavy chains and two light chains.
*$%pass: ey have a constant region and a variable region; the tip of the variable region is the antigen-binding When activated, the antigen-binding region undergoes hypermutation to improve the speciﬁcity of the antibody produced. Cells may be given signals to switch isotypes of antibody (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, IgA). Circulating antibodies can opsonize pathogens (mark them for destruction), cause agglutination (clumping) into insoluble complexes that are ingested by phagocytes, or neutralize pathogens. Cell-surface antibodies can activate immune cells or mediate allergic Memory B-cells lie in wait for a second exposure to a pathogen and can then mount a more rapid and vigorous immune response Cell-mediated (cytotoxic) immunity is centered on the functions of T-cells undergo maturation in the thymus through positive selection (only selecting for T-cells that can react to antigen presented on MHC) and negative selection (causing apoptosis in self-reactive T- cells). e peptide hormone thymosin promotes T-cell development. Helper T-cells (Th or CD4+) respond to antigen on MHC-II and coordinate the rest of the immune system, secreting lymphokines to activate various arms of immune defense. Th1 cells secrete interferon gamma, which activates macrophages. Th2 cells activate B-cells, primarily in parasitic infections. Cytotoxic T-cells (Tc, CTL, or CD8+) respond to antigen on MHC-I and kill virally infected cells. Suppressor (regulatory) T-cells (Treg) tone down the immune response aer an infection and promote self-tolerance. Memory T-cells serve a similar function to memory B-cells. In autoimmune conditions, a self-antigen is identiﬁed as foreign, and the immune system attacks the body’s own cells. In allergic reactions, nonthreatening exposures incite an inﬂammatory Immunization is a method of inducing active immunity (activation of B-cells that produce antibodies to an antigen) prior to exposure to a Passive immunity is the transfer of antibodies to an individual.
*$%pass: The Lymphatic System e lymphatic system is a circulatory system that consists of one-way vessels with intermittent lymph nodes. e lymphatic system connects to the cardiovascular system via the thoracic duct in the posterior chest. e lymphatic system equalizes ﬂuid distribution, transports fats and fat-soluble compounds in chylomicrons, and provides sites for mounting immune responses. Answers to Concept Checks 1. Innate immunity consists of defenses that are always active against pathogens, but that are not capable of targeting speciﬁc invaders. It takes longer to mount a response with adaptive immunity, but the response targets a speciﬁc pathogen and maintains immunologic memory of the infection to mount a faster response during subsequent infections. Bone marrow (but are activated in spleen or lymph and directly kill 3. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Agranulocytes include B- and T-cells (lymphocytes) and monocytes 1. Skin provides a physical barrier and secretes antimicrobial enzymes. Defensins are examples of antibacterial enzymes on the skin. Lysozyme is antimicrobial and is present in tears and saliva. Mucus is present on mucous membranes and traps incoming pathogens; in the respiratory system, cilia propel the mucus upward so it can be swallowed or expelled. Stomach acid is an antimicrobial substance in the digestive system. e normal gastrointestinal ﬂora provides competition, making it hard for pathogenic bacteria to grow in the gut. Complement is a set of proteins in the blood that can create holes in bacteria. 2. Professional antigen-presenting cells include macrophages, dendritic cells in the skin, some B-cells, and certain activated epithelial cells. 3. MHC-I is found in all nucleated cells and presents pieces of proteins (peptides) created within the cell (endogenous antigens); this can allow for detection of cells infected with intracellular pathogens (especially viruses).
*$%pass: MHC-II is only found in antigen-presenting cells and presents proteins that result from the digestion of extracellular pathogens that have been brought in by endocytosis (exogenous antigens). 4. Natural killer cells are activated by cells that do not present MHC (such as virally infected cells and cancer cells). Neutrophils are activated by bacteria, especially those that have been opsonized (tagged with an antibody on their surface). Eosinophils are activated by invasive parasites and allergens. Basophils and mast cells are activated by 1. Plasma cells form from B-cells exposed to antigen and produce antibodies. Memory B-cells also form from B-cells exposed to antigen and lie in wait for a second exposure to a given antigen to mount a rapid, robust response. Helper T-cells coordinate the immune system through lymphokines and respond to antigen bound to MHC-II. Cytotoxic T-cells directly kill virally infected cells and respond to antigen bound to MHC-I. Suppressor (regulatory) T-cells quell the immune response aer a pathogen has been cleared and promote self- tolerance. Memory T-cells, like memory B-cells, lie in wait until a second exposure to a pathogen to mount a rapid, robust response. 2. Circulating antibodies can mark a pathogen for destruction by phagocytic cells (opsonization), cause agglutination of the pathogen into insoluble complexes that can be taken up by phagocytic cells, or neutralize the pathogen by preventing it from invading tissues. 3. B-cells originally mature in the bone marrow and have some speciﬁcity at that point; however, antibodies that can respond to a given antigen undergo hypermutation, or rapid mutation of their antigen-binding sites. Only those B-cells that have the highest aﬃnity for the antigen survive and proliferate, increasing the speciﬁcity for the antigen over 4.
*$%pass: Positive selection occurs when T-cells in the thymus that are able to respond to antigen presented on MHC are allowed to survive (those that do not respond undergo apoptosis). Negative selection occurs when T-cells that respond to self-antigens undergo apoptosis before leaving the thymus. A T-cell that appropriately passes through positive selection, but then inappropriately passes through negative selection will be reactive to self-antigens. 5. Memory cells allow the immune system to carry out a much more rapid and robust secondary response. 6. Active immunity refers to the stimulation of the immune system to produce antibodies against a pathogen. Passive immunity refers to the transfer of antibodies to prevent infection, without stimulation of the plasma cells that produce these antibodies. 1. Fluid would be unable to return from the lower leg, and edema would result. is infection leads to elephantiasis, severe swelling of the limb with thickening of the skin. 2. e thoracic duct carries lymphatic ﬂuid into the le subclavian vein. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations T-lymphocytes, which mature in the thymus, are the only speciﬁc defense against intracellular pathogens. While some bacteria, fungi, and parasites can live intracellularly, viruses—by deﬁnition—must replicate within cells. e absence of T-cells would leave an individual unable to ﬁght viral infections with speciﬁc defenses. e lymphocytes involved in cell-mediated immunity are the T-lymphocytes, or T-cells. ere are four types of T-cells, each playing a diﬀerent role in cell-mediated immunity: cytotoxic T- cells, helper T-cells, memory T-cells, and suppressor T-cells. us, from the answer choices, the only cells not involved in cell-mediated immunity are the plasma cells, which are diﬀerentiated immunoglobulin-secreting B-lymphocytes involved in humoral immunity.
*$%pass: (B) is therefore the e main function of the lymphatic system is to collect excess interstitial ﬂuid and return it to the circulatory system, maintaining the balance of body ﬂuids. However, this is not one of the answer choices. In addition, the lymphatic system accepts chylomicrons from the small intestine and delivers them to the cardiovascular circulation. Transport of hormones is a function of the cardiovascular system, eliminating (A). e lymphatic system absorbs ﬂuid that has been pushed into tissues, but does not cause the extravasation of the ﬂuid, eliminating (C). Mast cells reside in (and are activated in) the skin and mucous membranes, eliminating (D). Antibodies are produced by plasma cells derived from B-lymphocytes. e other cells are all types of T-lymphocytes, although memory B-cells can also exist. Upon secondary antigen exposure, memory B-cells rapidly proliferate and diﬀerentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies. Memory B-cells do not directly produce antibodies. In this question, true statements should be eliminated. e innate immune system does include phagocytes like macrophages, which can activate an inﬂammatory response to recruit additional immune cells, eliminating (A). e innate immune system acts near entry points into the body and is always active, eliminating (B). Furthermore, all blood cells, including all cells of the immune system, are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, eliminating (D). By contrast, the innate immune system does not recognize speciﬁc antigens on a pathogen, making (C) correct. Adaptive immunity involves the activation of B-cells and T-cells speciﬁc to the encountered antigen. Any choice that conforms to this paradigm will be correct. (C) indicates that B-cells are activated. Pattern recognition receptors, or PRRs, in (A) recognize patterns common to certain pathogens, but do not identify the speciﬁc pathogen.
*$%pass: Complement is an example of a blood-borne nonspeciﬁc defense against bacteria, eliminating (B). Dendritic cells traveling to the lymph nodes (D) are a part of the interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems, but the dendritic cells themselves are nonspeciﬁc. Active immunity refers to the production of antibodies during an immune response. Active immunity may be conferred on an individual by vaccination, such as when an individual is injected with a weakened, inactive, or modiﬁed form of a particular antigen that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. Active immunity may require weeks to build. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of antibodies through, for example, breast milk. Another example of passive immunity would be during pregnancy, when some maternal antibodies cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation, conferring passive immunity to the fetus. Although passive immunity is acquired immediately, it is very short lived, lasting only as long as the antibodies circulate in blood. T-cells mature in the thymus, where they are “educated.” is education involves the elimination of T-cells with improper binding to MHC–antigen complexes (positive selection) and self-reactive T-cells (negative selection). us, self-reactive T-cells are eliminated in the Healthy cells exhibit MHC class I molecules. Natural killer cells monitor the expression of MHC molecules on the surface of cells. Viral infection and cancer oen cause a reduction in the expression of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. Natural killer cells detect this lack of MHC and induce apoptosis in the aﬀected cells. CD8+ T-cells are largely responsible for the cytotoxic immune response. By releasing toxic chemicals into virally infected cells, CD8+ T-cells are able to kill these cells in an eﬀort to contain viral infections.
*$%pass: Isotype switching refers to changes in the isotype of antibody produced, which is not caused by CD8+ cells, eliminating (B). Antigens are presented by macrophages, dendritic cells, certain epithelial cells, and some B-cells, eliminating (C). B-cells are not activated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, eliminating (D). Lymphocytes arise from the lymphoid lineage, which includes B-cells and T-cells. us, all types of B- and T-cells are capable of causing lymphoma. Macrophages, however, are not lymphocytes and are not likely to cause lymphoma. When the adaptive immune system encounters an antigen, only the cells with antibodies or T- cell receptors speciﬁc to that antigen are activated. is is known as clonal selection. While a T- cell response may be a cytotoxic response, it could also be the activation of helper T-cells; plus, this does not explain the speciﬁcity of the response, eliminating (B). e only phagocytes that attack bacteria on this list are neutrophils and dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are able to sample and present any type of material, and reside in the skin. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are present in the bloodstream and can attack bacteria present there or in tissues. Eosinophils and basophils are involved in the development of allergies; eosinophils also defend against parasites. e spleen is a location where B-cells mature and proliferate. erefore, removal of the spleen is likely to result in a reduction of humoral immunity. In fact, many people receive vaccinations prior to removal of the spleen in order to bolster their immunity. e body employs a number of nonspeciﬁc defense mechanisms against foreign invasion. e skin and mucous membranes provide a physical barrier against bacterial invasion. In addition, sweat contains enzymes that attack bacterial cell walls. Certain passages, such as the respiratory tract, are lined with ciliate mucus-coated epithelia, which ﬁlter and trap foreign particles.
*$%pass: Macrophages engulf and destroy foreign particles. e inﬂammatory response is initiated in response to physical damage. e only choice that is not a nonspeciﬁc defense mechanism is (D), the correct answer. Cytotoxic T-cells are involved in (speciﬁc) cell-mediated immunity. Consult your online resources for additional practice.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems As we continue our survey of organ systems, we now come to the digestive system. As with our previous reviews of other organ systems, we will start with a basic anatomical overview of the organs of digestion (including the accessory organs) and then move on to discuss how these organs function to provide nutrition to the individual. e food we eat is complex, incorporating meats, grains, vegetables and fruits, dairy products, and nuts. e job of the digestive system is to take these complex foods—composed of polysaccharides, fats, and proteins—and turn large macromolecules into smaller, simpler monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids.
*$%pass: In order to cleave all of these bonds, the body requires a complex system of mechanical and chemical agents. ese compounds can then be absorbed from the gut, transported to the tissues by the circulatory system, and used by cells. In this chapter, we will consider the organs that make up the digestive system as well as the processes by which the foods we eat become the fuel we need for energy, growth, development, and maintenance of other essential activities. Anatomy of the Digestive System After Chapter 9.1, you will be able to: Describe mechanical and chemical digestion and differentiate between them Identify the interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and the digestive system Trace the path of food through the body, naming major organs and valves in the ere are two types of digestion that occur. First, intracellular digestion, as a part of metabolism, involves the oxidation of glucose and fatty acids for energy. However, our diets do not consist of pure glucose and fatty acids; rather, these substances must be extracted from our food. e process by which these nutrients are obtained from food occurs within the lumen of the alimentary canal and is known as extracellular digestion. is is technically “outside” the body, because the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract communicates directly with the outside world. e alimentary canal runs from the mouth to the anus and is sectioned oﬀ by sphincters, or circular smooth muscles around the canal that can contract to allow compartmentalization of function. e human digestive tract has specialized sections with diﬀerent functional roles. e most basic functional distinction is between digestion and absorption. Digestion involves the breakdown of food monosaccharides, lipids (fats) into free fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids.
*$%pass: Digestion can be subdivided into mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large food particles into smaller food particles, but does not involve breaking chemical bonds. Chemical digestion is the enzymatic cleavage of chemical bonds, such as the peptide bonds of proteins or the glycosidic bonds of starches. Absorption involves the transport of products of digestion from the digestive tract into the circulatory system for distribution to the body’s tissues and cells. e digestive tract, shown in Figure 9.1, begins with the oral cavity (mouth) followed by the pharynx, a shared pathway for both food entering the digestive system and air entering the respiratory system. From the pharynx, food enters the esophagus, which transports it to the stomach. From the stomach, food travels to the small intestine, and then to the large intestine. Finally, waste products of digestion enter the rectum, where feces are stored until an appropriate time of release. In addition to the digestive tract itself, the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder help to provide the enzymes and lubrication necessary to aid in the digestion of food. labeled: mouth, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, appendix, rectum, anus Figure 9.1 Anatomy of the Digestive System e enteric nervous system is a collection of one hundred million neurons that govern the function of the gastrointestinal system. ese neurons are present in the walls of the digestive tract and trigger peristalsis, or rhythmic contractions of the gut tube, in order to move materials through the system. is system can function independently of the brain and spinal cord, although it is heavily regulated by the autonomic nervous system. e parasympathetic division is involved in stimulation of digestive activities, increasing secretions from exocrine glands and promoting peristalsis.
*$%pass: e sympathetic division is involved in the inhibition of these activities. e fact that so oen we feel sleepy and lethargic aer eating a big meal (oen called a food coma colloquially) is due, in part, to parasympathetic activity. On the other hand, during periods of high sympathetic activity, bloodﬂow is decreased to the digestive tract, and gut motility slows signiﬁcantly. All of the glands of the body (except sweat glands) are innervated by the parasympathetic Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Bile acids are crucial for the intestinal absorption of dietary fatty acids, of cholesterol, and of fat-soluble vitamins. To determine whether the interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids alters triglyceride and glucose metabolism, researchers tested ileal This is just background Purpose: determine whether removing bile acids changes sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Slc10a2) KO mice. Over 95% of intestinal bile acid is absorbed and returned to the liver; thus, knocking out Slc10a2 should dramatically reduce the total pool of bile acid in the body (approx. 80% reduction). In addition, some mice were fed a sucrose-rich (SR) diet to simulate the metabolic stress of an unhealthy diet. A new abbreviation “KO” is here, but the next sentence says “knocking out”, so I know this must stand for “Knock Out” This details the IVs: normal vs reduced bile acids and regular vs Figure 1 Expression of sterol regulatory element- binding protein 1 (Srebp1) Protein Immunoblot.

(2012) Inhibition of intestinal bile acid transporter Slc10a2 improves triglyceride metabolism and normalizes elevated plasma glucose Would reducing the total pool of bile acid be a good strategy to combat the hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes induced by an unhealthy diet? is question asks whether an action, reducing the total pool of bile acid, would have a speciﬁed impact on two conditions, hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes. To answer this question, we must assess the data we are given in the article regarding how changing bile acid quantity aﬀects traits and outcomes associated with those We should start by making sure we’re comfortable with the terms used in the question, relying on either the article or our critical thinking skills to ﬁll our knowledge gaps. Hypertriglyceridemia is a condition when blood triglyceride levels are too high, and diabetes is a condition when blood glucose levels are too high.
*$%pass: However, that information wasn’t given to us in the passage, and it’s not entirely in scope for Test Day—so how could we ﬁgure out what we need to know to answer this question? Even if we didn’t know this, though, we know the mice were fed food to simulate an unhealthy diet that would supply them with too much sugar, and we should recognize at least diabetes as a metabolic disorder linked with sugar metabolism. We should also recognize that triglycerides are fats, so this is probably a condition involving fat metabolism. us, we can assume that any action that lowers blood triglycerides (relating to hypertriglyceridemia) and blood glucose (relating to diabetes) could constitute a potentially beneﬁcial therapy for these two conditions. So, when we look at the data for the experimental mice as compared to controls, we should be looking for changes related to these two metabolic pathways to determine if there are possible treatment implications for reducing bile salt concentrations in order to treat According to the passage, the knockout mice do not have the bile acid transporter, meaning that the pool of available bile acid in their system should be signiﬁcantly lower. ere’s also a second variable, diet, which should be simulating mice that are experiencing metabolic stressors in the sucrose-rich condition as compared to normal metabolic function. Figure 1 shows the concentration of a protein involved in fatty acid synthesis in the KO mice versus wild- type mice, with both normal and sucrose-rich diets. In the wild-type mice, we can see that the addition of a metabolically stressful, high- sugar diet (lane 3) leads to a big increase in production of that protein as compared to regular diet (lane 1).
*$%pass: However, in the knockout mice, there’s no perceivable change from the regular diet (lane 2) to the sucrose-rich diet (lane 4). is is true both for the actual protein and the precursor, which means that the KO mouse is just not transcribing as much of that metabolic protein. e lamin lane down at the bottom seems like it’s just a control for protein expression, and it looks pretty much the same across the board, so we can ignore it in our data analysis. Based on this ﬁgure, which is all about a metabolic protein in the fatty acid synthesis chain, it looks like the knockout mice just aren’t experiencing the same amount of metabolic stress; they’re not trying to turn that extra sucrose into fatty acids. Based on this piece of data, it looks like reducing bile acid might be one way to relieve the metabolic stress associated with hypertriglyceridemia, or at least, it’s worth more investigation! Moving on, Figure 2 shows the same conditions, but is measuring mRNA production of two diﬀerent proteins: glucokinase and pyruvate kinase. Even if we aren’t exactly sure of what those enzymes do, they have glucose and pyruvate in their names, so it sounds like they are probably involved in the sugar metabolism pathway. Looking at the ﬁgure, we can see in the ﬁrst two pairs of columns that wild-type mice are expressing more mRNA for both of these proteins than KO mice. Aer metabolic stress is added, it looks like pyruvate kinase production speciﬁcally spikes within the KO mice. at seems to indicate that these mice are responding to the metabolic stress to an even greater extent (in terms of Lpk) than the wild-type mice.
*$%pass: Without directly measuring the level of blood glucose, we cannot determine whether that increased metabolic response represents a positive or negative trend. So, unlike the data in Figure 1, it looks like bile salt reduction may not be a good treatment option for diabetic individuals, and we may even need to reevaluate whether it would be truly helpful for those with triglyceridemia, as the energetic processing of fats can’t be considered as fully separate from the processing of sugars. Overall, our takeaway is that we have mixed results. Figure 1 made the reduction of bile salts look like a promising treatment for triglyceridemia, but Figure 2 indicates that reducing bile salts may not be eﬀective in treating diabetes. We can conclude that more data is needed to assess this therapy’s eﬀect on sugar and lipid MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 9.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What is the difference between mechanical and chemical digestion? 2. Trace the path of food through the body, starting with ingestion and ending with excretion of feces: 3. What effect does the parasympathetic nervous system have on the digestive system? What effect does the sympathetic nervous system have? Parasympathetic nervous system: Sympathetic nervous system: Ingestion and Digestion After Chapter 9.2, you will be able to: Identify the secretory cells of the digestive tract, their secretions, and the function of their secretions Explain how bile and pancreatic lipase work together to digest fats Recall the key digestive enzymes and hormones produced in saliva, the stomach, and the intestines, and summarize the function of each To supply the body with nutrients, we must ingest (eat) food. Several hormones are involved with feeding behavior, including antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin), aldosterone, glucagon, ghrelin, leptin, and cholecystokinin.
*$%pass: ADH and aldosterone trigger the sensation of thirst, encouraging the behavior of ﬂuid consumption. Glucagon, secreted by the pancreas, and ghrelin, secreted by the stomach and pancreas, stimulate feelings of hunger. Leptin and cholecystokinin do the opposite, stimulating feelings of satiety. Digestion begins in the oral cavity and continues in the stomach and the ﬁrst part of the small intestine, known as the duodenum. e oral cavity plays a role in both mechanical and chemical digestion of food. Mechanical digestion in the mouth involves the breaking up of large food particles into smaller particles using the teeth, tongue, and lips. is process is called mastication (chewing). Chewing helps to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the food, creating more surface area for enzymatic digestion as it passes through the gut tube. It also moderates the size of food particles entering the lumen of the alimentary canal; food particles that are too large create an obstruction risk in the tract. The chemical digestion of carbohydrates occurs in both the mouth and small intestine, with the two amylases targeting complementary starches. Salivary amylase (active in the mouth) has a higher specificity for rapidly soluble starches, while pancreatic amylase (active in the small intestine) has a higher specificity for less soluble, more nonpolar starches. Chemical digestion is the breakdown of chemical bonds in the macromolecules that make up food. is relies on enzymes from saliva produced by the three pairs of salivary glands. Saliva also aids mechanical digestion by moistening and lubricating food. e salivary glands, like all glands of the digestive tract, are innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system. e presence of food in the oral cavity triggers a neural circuit that ultimately leads to increased parasympathetic stimulation of these glands.
*$%pass: Salivation can also be triggered by signals that food is near, such as smell or sight. Saliva contains salivary amylase, also known as ptyalin, and lipase. Salivary amylase is capable of hydrolyzing starch into smaller sugars (maltose and dextrins), while lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of lipids. e amount of chemical digestion that occurs in the mouth is minimal, though, because the food does not stay in the mouth for long. Our muscular tongue forms the food into a bolus, which is forced back to the pharynx and There are three pairs of major salivary glands: the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Other microscopic salivary glands are scattered throughout the upper digestive system. While the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for promoting salivation, the sympathetic nervous system has some input into the glands as well. The sympathetic nervous system increases the viscosity of saliva, which is why dry mouth and even a tacky sensation in the mouth occurs during a fight-or-flight response. e pharynx is the cavity that leads from the mouth and posterior nasal cavity to the esophagus. e pharynx connects not only to the esophagus, but also to the larynx, which is a part of the respiratory tract. e pharynx can be divided into three parts: the nasopharynx (behind the nasal cavity), the oropharynx (at the back of the mouth), and the laryngopharynx (above the vocal cords). Food is prevented from entering the larynx during swallowing by the epiglottis, a cartilaginous structure that folds down to cover the laryngeal inlet. Failure of this mechanism can lead to aspiration of food and choking. e esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx to the stomach.
*$%pass: e top third of the esophagus is composed of skeletal muscle, the bottom third is composed of smooth muscle, and the middle third is a mix of both. What does this mean in terms of nervous control? While the top of the esophagus is under somatic (voluntary) motor control, the bottom—and most of the rest of the gastrointestinal tract, for that matter—is under autonomic (involuntary) nervous control. e rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle that propels food toward the stomach is called peristalsis. Under normal circumstances, peristalsis proceeds down the digestive tract. However, certain factors such as exposure to chemicals, infectious agents, physical stimulation in the posterior pharynx, and even cognitive stimulation, can lead to reversal of peristalsis in the process of emesis (vomiting). Swallowing is initiated in the muscles of the oropharynx, which constitute the upper esophageal sphincter. Peristalsis squeezes, pushes, and propels the bolus toward the stomach. As the bolus approaches the stomach, a muscular ring known as the lower esophageal sphincter (cardiac sphincter) relaxes and opens to allow the passage of food. Weakness in the lower esophageal sphincter is a key feature of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which causes classic heartburn symptoms after eating. As food and acid reflux into the lower esophagus, they irritate the less-protected mucosa, stimulating pain receptors. These receptors localize pain poorly, so a general burning sensation is felt in the lower chest—leading to the common term heartburn. ere are three main energy sources: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. As mentioned earlier, the chemical digestion of carbohydrates and fats is initiated in the mouth. No mechanical or chemical digestion takes place in the esophagus, except for the continued enzymatic activity initiated in the mouth by salivary enzymes.
*$%pass: us, digestion that occurs prior to the entrance of the bolus into the stomach is minimal compared to the digestion that occurs in the stomach and small intestine. e stomach is a highly muscular organ with a capacity of approximately two liters. In humans, the stomach is located in the upper le quadrant of the abdominal cavity, underneath the diaphragm. is organ uses hydrochloric acid and enzymes to digest food, creating a fairly harsh environment. erefore, its mucosa is quite thick to prevent autodigestion. e stomach can be divided into four main anatomical divisions, as shown in Figure 9.2: the fundus and body, which contain mostly gastric glands, and the antrum and pylorus, which contain mostly pyloric glands. e internal curvature of the stomach is called the lesser curvature; the external curvature is called the greater curvature. e lining of the stomach is thrown into folds called rugae. labeled: esophagus, fundus, body, pylorus, antrum, pyloric sphincter, duodenum, lesser and greater curvature, angular notch, Figure 9.2 Anatomy of the Stomach Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, are very common drugs. However, these drugs are not without side effects. One such side effect is the disruption of mucus production within the stomach. This leaves the mucosa of the stomach unprotected, and irritation results. This irritation can be in the form of gastritis, inflammation of the mucosa of the stomach, or gastric ulcers, deep wounds in the lining of e mucosa of the stomach contains gastric glands and pyloric glands. e gastric glands respond to signals from the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is activated by the brain in response to the sight, taste, and smell of food. Gastric glands have three diﬀerent cell types: mucous cells, chief cells, and parietal cells.
*$%pass: Mucous cells produce the bicarbonate-rich mucus that protects the muscular wall from the harshly acidic (pH = 2) and proteolytic environment of the stomach. The stomach secretes six products: 1. HCl (kills microbes, denatures proteins, and converts pepsinogen into pepsin) 2. Pepsinogen (cleaved in the stomach to pepsin; an enzyme that partially digests 3. Mucus (protects mucosa) 4. Bicarbonate (protects mucosa) 5. Water (dissolves and dilutes ingested material) 6. Intrinsic factor (required for normal absorption of vitamin B12) Gastric juice is a combination of secretions from the other two cell types in the gastric glands: chief cells and parietal cells. e chief cells secrete pepsinogen. is is the inactive, zymogen form of pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme. Hydrogen ions in the stomach, secreted by parietal cells as hydrochloric acid, cleave pepsinogen to pepsin. Pepsin digests proteins by cleaving peptide bonds near aromatic amino acids, resulting in short peptide fragments. Because pepsin is activated by the acidic environment, it follows that pepsin is most active at a low pH. is is a unique characteristic among human enzymes, as most human enzymes are most active at physiological pH. Stomach acid also kills most harmful bacteria (with the exception of Helicobacter pylori, infection with which is usually asymptomatic but can cause inﬂammation, ulcers, and even certain gastric cancers). e acidic environment also helps to denature proteins and can break down some intramolecular bonds that hold food together. In addition to HCl, parietal cells secrete intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein involved in the proper absorption of vitamin B12. e pyloric glands contain G-cells that secrete gastrin, a peptide hormone. Gastrin induces the parietal cells in the stomach to secrete more HCl and signals the stomach to contract, mixing its contents.
*$%pass: e digestion of solid food in the stomach results in an acidic, semiﬂuid mixture known as chyme. e combined mechanical and chemical digestive activities of the stomach result in a signiﬁcant increase in the surface area of the now unrecognizable food particles, so when the chyme reaches the small intestine, the absorption of nutrients from it can be maximized. ere are a few substances that are absorbed directly from the stomach (such as alcohol and aspirin), but the stomach is mainly an organ of digestion. Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is a rare disease resulting from a gastrin-secreting tumor (gastrinoma). Typically, this tumor is found in the pancreas. The excess gastrin leads to excessive HCl production by parietal cells. Not surprisingly, one of the most common signs of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is the presence of intractable ulcer disease. e small intestine consists of three segments: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. e small intestine is quite long, up to seven meters. e duodenum is responsible for the majority of chemical digestion and has some minor involvement in absorption. However, most of the absorption in the small intestine takes place in the jejunum and ileum. Food leaves the stomach through the pyloric sphincter and enters the duodenum. e presence of chyme in the duodenum causes the release of brush-border enzymes like disaccharidases (maltase, isomaltase, lactase, and sucrase) and peptidases (including dipeptidase). Brush-border enzymes are present on the luminal surface of cells lining the duodenum and break down dimers and trimers of biomolecules into absorbable monomers. e duodenum also secretes enteropeptidase, which is involved in the activation of other digestive enzymes from the accessory organs of digestion. Finally, it secretes hormones like secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK) into the e disaccharidases digest disaccharides. Maltase digests maltose, isomaltase digests isomaltose, lactase digests lactose, and sucrase digests sucrose.
*$%pass: Lack of a particular disaccharidase causes an inability to break down the corresponding disaccharide. en bacteria in the intestines are able to hydrolyze that disaccharide, producing methane gas as a byproduct. In addition, undigested disaccharides can have an osmotic eﬀect, pulling water into the stool and causing diarrhea. is is why people who are lactose intolerant have symptoms of bloating, ﬂatulence, and possibly diarrhea aer ingesting dairy products. Peptidases break down proteins (or peptides, as the name implies). Aminopeptidase is a peptidase secreted by glands in the duodenum that removes the N-terminal amino acid from a peptide. Dipeptidases cleave the peptide bonds of dipeptides to release free amino acids. Unlike carbohydrates, which must be broken down into monosaccharides for absorption, proteins can be broken down into di- and even tripeptides and can be absorbed across the small intestine wall. Celiac disease results from an immune reaction against gluten, a protein found in grains, especially wheat. In this condition, the immune system develops antibodies against certain components of gluten. These antibodies then cross-react with elements of the small intestine, causing damage to the mucosa. This results in diarrhea and discomfort. Sometimes, this condition also results in malabsorptive syndromes, including the inability to absorb fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Contrary to popular belief, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are immune conditions, but not true allergies. Enteropeptidase (formerly called enterokinase) is an enzyme critical for the activation of trypsinogen, a pancreatic protease, to trypsin. Trypsin then initiates an activation procarboxypeptidases A and B to their Secretin is a peptide hormone that causes pancreatic enzymes to be released into the duodenum. It also regulates the pH of the digestive tract by reducing HCl secretion from parietal cells and increasing bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas.
*$%pass: Secretin is also an enterogastrone, a hormone that slows motility through the digestive tract. Slowing of motility allows increased time for digestive enzymes to act on chyme—especially fats. Finally, cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted in response to the entry of chyme (speciﬁcally, amino acids and fat in the chyme) into the duodenum. is peptide hormone stimulates the release of both bile and pancreatic juices and also acts in the brain, where it promotes satiety. Bile is a complex ﬂuid composed of bile salts, pigments, and cholesterol. Bile salts are derived from cholesterol. ey are not enzymes and therefore do not directly perform chemical digestion (the enzymatic cleavage of chemical bonds). However, bile salts serve an important role in the mechanical digestion of fats and ultimately facilitate the chemical digestion of lipids. Bile salts have hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, allowing them to serve as a bridge between aqueous and lipid environments. In fact, bile salts are much like the common soaps and detergents we use to wash our hands, clothes, and dishes. In the small intestine, bile salts emulsify fats and cholesterol into micelles. Without bile, fats would spontaneously separate out of the aqueous mixture in the duodenum and would not be accessible to pancreatic lipase, which is water-soluble. In addition, these micelles increase the surface area of the fats, increasing the rate at which lipase can act. Ultimately, proper fat digestion depends on both bile and lipase. Bile gets the fats into the solution and increases their surface area by placing them in micelles (mechanical digestion). en, lipase can come in to hydrolyze the ester bonds holding the lipids together (chemical digestion). CCK also promotes the secretion of pancreatic juices into the duodenum, as shown in Figure 9.3.
*$%pass: Pancreatic juices are a complex mixture of several enzymes in a bicarbonate-rich alkaline solution. is bicarbonate helps to neutralize acidic chyme, as well as provide an ideal working environment for the digestive enzymes, which are most active around pH 8.5. Pancreatic juices contain enzymes that can digest all three types of nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. e identities and functions of these enzymes will be discussed in the next section of this chapter. CCK, stimulated by duodenal fat and amino acids, and parasympathetic innervation cause enzyme release from the pancreas; secretin, stimulated by duodenal acid, causes bicarbonate and ﬂuid release from the pancreas Figure 9.3 Hormonal Control of the Exocrine Pancreas The acidic environment of the stomach and basic environment of the duodenum point out the important correlation between pH and enzyme activity. Pepsin is active in the stomach and works best at pH 2. Pancreatic enzymes are active in the duodenum and work best at pH 8.5. pH, temperature, and salinity can all affect enzyme function, as highlighted in Chapter 2 of MCAT Biochemistry Review.

For each of the following substances, determine whether it is a digestive enzyme or a hormone and briefly summarize its functions. Enzyme or Hormone? 4. How do bile and pancreatic lipase work together to digest fats?
*$%pass: Accessory Organs of Digestion After Chapter 9.3, you will be able to: Recall the pancreatic enzymes and the molecules they help to digest Describe the significance and the function of bile, including its production, components, and release List the major functions of the liver Associate the accessory organs of digestion with their germ layer of origin Digestion is a complex process that requires the release of enzymes not only from the cells directly lining the alimentary canal, but also from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Collectively, these organs—which all originate as outgrowths of endoderm from the gut tube during development —are called accessory organs of digestion. e pancreas serves two quite diﬀerent roles in the body, reﬂecting its exocrine and endocrine functions. As discussed in Chapter 5 of MCAT Biology Review, the endocrine functions of the pancreas include the release of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin—peptide hormones necessary for the maintenance of proper blood sugar levels. e hormonal function of the pancreas is limited to cells residing in islets of Langerhans scattered throughout the organ. e bulk of the pancreas, however, is made of exocrine cells called acinar cells that produce pancreatic juices. As mentioned earlier, pancreatic juices are bicarbonate-rich alkaline secretions containing many digestive enzymes that work on all three classes of biomolecules. Pancreatic amylase breaks down large polysaccharides into small disaccharides and is therefore responsible for carbohydrate digestion. e pancreatic peptidases (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and carboxypeptidases A and B) are released in their zymogen form, but once activated are responsible for protein digestion. Enteropeptidase, produced by the duodenum, is the master switch. It converts trypsinogen to trypsin, which can then activate the other zymogens, and also activates procarboxypeptidases A and B.
*$%pass: Finally, the pancreas secretes pancreatic lipase, which is capable of breaking down fats into free fatty acids and Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is usually caused by gallstones or excessive consumption of alcohol. Regardless of the cause, pancreatitis results from premature activation of pancreatic enzymes and autodigestion of the pancreatic tissue. This is a very painful condition that may result in a long hospital stay and long-term consequences such as diabetes and the reduced digestion of proteins and fats. Pancreatic juices are transferred to the duodenum via a duct system that runs along the middle of the pancreas, as shown in Figure 9.4. Like all exocrine cells, acinar cells secrete their products into ducts. ese ducts then empty into the duodenum through the major and minor duodenal labeled: head, body, and tail; lobules, pancreatic and accessory pancreatic ducts, gallbladder and bile duct, major and minor duodenal papillae, duodenum Figure 9.4 Anatomy of the Pancreas The functions of the liver include processing and synthesis gluconeogenesis), production of urea, detoxification of chemicals, production of bile, and synthesis of albumin and clotting factors. e liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and contains two unique structures for communicating with the digestive system. First, bile ducts connect the liver with both the gallbladder and small intestine. Bile is produced in the liver and travels down these bile ducts where it may be stored in the gallbladder or secreted into the duodenum. e liver also receives all blood draining from the abdominal portion of the digestive tract through the hepatic portal vein. is nutrient-rich blood can be processed by the liver before draining into the inferior vena cava on its way to the right side of the heart.
*$%pass: For example, the liver takes up excess sugar to create glycogen, the storage form of glucose, and stores fats as triacylglycerols. e liver can also reverse these processes, producing glucose for the rest of the body through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and mobilizing fats in lipoproteins. e liver detoxiﬁes both endogenous compounds (those made in the body) and exogenous compounds (those brought in from the environment). For example, the liver converts ammonia, a toxic waste product of amino acid metabolism, into urea, which can be excreted by the kidneys. e liver also detoxiﬁes and metabolizes alcohol and medications. Some drugs actually require activation by the enzymes of the liver. In addition, some drugs cannot be taken orally because modiﬁcation of these drugs by the liver renders them inactive. The major components of bile are bile salts, which emulsify fats; pigments (especially bilirubin, from the breakdown of hemoglobin); and cholesterol. Bile production is one of the most signiﬁcant jobs of the liver vis-à-vis the digestive system. As mentioned earlier, bile is composed of bile salts, pigments, and cholesterol. Bile salts are amphipathic molecules that can emulsify fat in the digestive system. e major pigment in bile is bilirubin, which is a byproduct of the breakdown of hemoglobin. Bilirubin travels to the liver, where it is conjugated (attached to a protein) and secreted into the bile for excretion. If the liver is unable to process or excrete bilirubin (due to liver damage, excessive red blood cell destruction, or blockage of the bile ducts), jaundice or yellowing of the skin may occur. In addition to bile production, processing of nutrients, and detoxiﬁcation and drug metabolism, the liver also synthesizes certain proteins necessary for proper body function.
*$%pass: ese proteins include albumin, a protein that maintains plasma oncotic pressure and also serves as a carrier for many drugs and hormones, and clotting factors used during blood coagulation. Cirrhosis of the liver can result from many different processes, including chronic alcohol consumption, hepatitis C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, and fatty liver disease. However, the outcome is the same. Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, and this scar tissue builds up, creating increased resistance within the portal vein, resulting in portal hypertension. This causes a backup of fluid within the portal system, resulting in swollen veins in the digestive system, especially the esophagus, which may rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding. This often manifests as hematemesis, or vomiting of blood. Cirrhosis also causes bleeding disorders because production of clotting factors is disrupted. The inability to properly dispose of ammonia results in increased ammonia in the blood, which affects mentation. Finally, cirrhosis may also cause hepatocellular carcinoma, or cancer of the hepatocytes. Stone formation is nothing more than precipitation of a solid once its concentration has reached the Ksp of the compound. This is particularly common in the gallbladder because bile is concentrated there. Solubility and Ksp are discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT General e gallbladder is located just beneath the liver and both stores and concentrates bile. Upon release of CCK, the gallbladder contracts and pushes bile out into the biliary tree. e bile duct system merges with the pancreatic duct, as shown in Figure 9.4 earlier, before emptying into the e gallbladder is a common site of cholesterol or bilirubin stone formation. is painful condition causes inﬂammation of the gallbladder. e stones may also travel into the bile ducts and get stuck in the biliary tree.

*$%pass: Absorption and Defecation After Chapter 9.4, you will be able to: Recall the four fat-soluble vitamins Order the three sections of the small intestine and the three sections of the large Predict the portions of the gut impacted by a disease when given a digestive symptom, such as watery stool Identify the biomolecules typically absorbed into each vessel of the villus: structure of a villus Absorption of nutrients primarily occurs in the small intestine, especially in the jejunum and ileum. e large intestine largely absorbs water. Jejunum and Ileum e small intestine consists of three segments: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. As discussed previously, the duodenum is primarily involved in digestion. e jejunum and ileum are involved in the absorption of nutrients. e small intestine is lined with villi, which are small, ﬁnger-like projections from the epithelial lining, as shown in Figure 9.6. Each villus has many microvilli, drastically increasing the surface area available for absorption. In addition, at the middle of each villus there is a capillary bed for the absorption of water-soluble nutrients and a lacteal, a lymphatic channel that takes up fats for transport into the lymphatic system. labeled: villus, microvilli, lacteal, capillaries, lymphatic vessel Figure 9.6 Structure of a Villus Segments of the small intestine: Dow Jones Industrial Simple sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and galactose, and amino acids are absorbed by secondary active transport and facilitated diﬀusion into the epithelial cells lining the small intestine, as shown in Figure 9.7. en, these substances move across the epithelial cell membrane into the intestinal capillaries. Blood is constantly passing by the epithelial cells, carrying the carbohydrate and amino acid molecules away. is creates a concentration gradient such that the blood always has a lower concentration of monosaccharides and amino acids than inside the epithelial cells.
*$%pass: us, simple carbohydrates and amino acids diﬀuse from the epithelial cells into the capillaries. e absorbed molecules then go to the liver via the hepatic nutrients brought in by coupling to sodium and/or hydrogen ions; peptides broken down inside cell; monosaccharides and amino acids brought into blood by facilitated diﬀusion Figure 9.7 Absorption of Carbohydrates and Amino Acids in the Small Intestine What about fats? Short-chain fatty acids will follow the same process as carbohydrates and amino acids by diﬀusing directly into the intestinal capillaries. ese fatty acids do not require transporters because they are nonpolar, so they can easily traverse the cellular membrane. Larger fats, glycerol, and cholesterol move separately into the intestinal cells but then reform into triglycerides, as shown in Figure 9.8. e triglycerides and esteriﬁed cholesterol molecules are packaged into chylomicrons. Rather than entering the bloodstream, chylomicrons enter the lymphatic circulation through lacteals, small vessels that form the beginning of the lymphatic system. ese lacteals converge and enter the venous circulation at the thoracic duct in the base of the neck, which empties into the le subclavian fatty acids, 2 monoacylglycerol, phospholipids, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins in micelle, brought into mucosal cell and packaged as chylomicron, which is put into lymph. short-chain fatty acids and bile salts travel to blood Figure 9.8 Absorption of Lipids Vitamins are also absorbed in the small intestine. Vitamins can be categorized as either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Because there are only four fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), these can be easily memorized. All other vitamins (B complex and C) are water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve directly into chylomicrons to enter the lymphatic circulation.
*$%pass: Failure to digest and absorb fat properly, which can be due to pathologies in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, or small intestine, may lead to deﬁciencies of fat-soluble vitamins. e water-soluble vitamins are taken up, along with water, amino acids, and carbohydrates, across the endothelial cells of the small intestine, passing directly into the plasma. In addition to fats, carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins, the small intestine also absorbs water. Much of the water in chyme is actually the result of secretions. e average person may consume up to two liters of ﬂuid per day, but secretions into the upper gastrointestinal tract may total up to seven liters of ﬂuid per day. In order to maintain proper ﬂuid levels within the body, much of this ﬂuid must be reabsorbed by osmosis. As solutes are absorbed into the bloodstream, water is drawn with them, eventually reaching the capillaries. Water passes not only transcellularly (across the cell membrane), but also paracellularly (squeezing between cells) to reach the blood. e ﬁnal part of the gastrointestinal tract is the large intestine. It is primarily involved in water absorption. e large intestine has a larger diameter but shorter length than the small intestine. It is divided into three major sections: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. e cecum is simply an outpocketing that accepts ﬂuid exiting the small intestine through the ileocecal valve and is the site of attachment of the appendix. e appendix is a small ﬁnger-like projection that was once thought to be vestigial. Recent evidence, however, suggests that it may have a role in warding oﬀ certain bacterial infections and repopulating the large intestine with normal ﬂora aer episodes of diarrhea.
*$%pass: Inﬂammation of the appendix (appendicitis) is a surgical emergency; in fact, it is the most common reason for an unscheduled surgery in the United States. e colon itself is divided into the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colons. Its main function is to absorb water and salts (such as sodium chloride) from the undigested material le over from the small intestine. e small intestine actually absorbs much more water than the colon, so the colon primarily concentrates the remaining material to form feces. Too little or too much water absorption can cause diarrhea or Finally, the rectum serves as a storage site for feces, which consists of indigestible material, water, bacteria (E. coli and others), and certain digestive secretions that are not reabsorbed (enzymes and some bile). e anus is the opening through which wastes are eliminated and consists of two sphincters: the internal and external anal sphincters. e external sphincter is under voluntary control (somatic), but the internal sphincter is under involuntary control (autonomic). Note the similarity between the muscles that control voiding of urine and feces. In both cases, there is an internal sphincter under autonomic control (internal urethral sphincter and internal anal sphincter) and an external sphincter under somatic control (external urethral sphincter and external anal sphincter). Urination is discussed in Chapter 10 of MCAT e large intestine—and even the small intestine—is home to many diﬀerent species of bacteria. In fact, 30 percent of the dry matter in stool consists of bacteria. Most of these bacteria are anaerobes, but the cecum is also home to many aerobic bacteria. e presence of bacteria in the colon represents a symbiotic relationship: the bacteria are provided with a steady source of food, and the byproducts produced by the bacteria are beneﬁcial to humans.
*$%pass: For example, bacteria in the gut produce vitamin K, which is essential for the production of clotting factors, and biotin (vitamin B7), which is a coenzyme for many metabolic enzymes. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 9.4 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are the two circulatory vessels in a villus? What biomolecules are absorbed 2. What are the four fat-soluble vitamins? 3. What are the three sections of the small intestine, in order? What are the three sections of the large intestine, in order? Small intestine: _____________________, 4. Vibrio cholera causes a severe infection in the intestines, leading to massive volumes of watery diarrhea—up to 20 liters per day. Given these symptoms, does cholera likely impact the small intestine or the large intestine? In this chapter, we have reviewed a lot of information about the digestive system that we can use to our advantage on Test Day. We began with an overview of the anatomy, keeping in mind that the system is designed to carry out extracellular digestion. Considering that all our foodstuﬀs are made up of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, these compounds have to be broken down to their simplest molecular forms before they can be absorbed and distributed to the tissues and cells of the body. As we moved through the gastrointestinal tract, we discussed whether each organ was a site of absorption, digestion, or both. We spent a good bit of time discussing each of the enzymes involved in digestion and their speciﬁc purposes. While digestion occurs primarily in the oral cavity, stomach, and duodenum, absorption occurs primarily in the jejunum and ileum, where the method of transport into the circulatory system is slightly diﬀerent depending on the compound.
*$%pass: Finally, we discussed the three segments of the large intestine and their roles in water and salt absorption, as well as the temporary storage of waste products. Although the amount of information about the digestive system may seem overwhelming, the underlying concepts are relatively straightforward, and a systematic approach (such as charts, tables, or ﬂashcards) will help you manage this content. In the end, the digestive system’s main purpose is to break down energy- containing compounds and get them into the circulation so they can be used by the rest of the body. Equally important are the systems the body has for getting rid of compounds from the blood. Buildup of waste products like ammonia, urea, potassium, and hydrogen ions can lead to serious pathology. For instance, hyperammonemia (buildup of ammonia in the blood) can lead to severe, permanent neurological damage. Hyperkalemia (buildup of potassium in the blood) can quickly cause a fatal heart attack. Temperature regulation is similarly important; both hyperthermia and hypothermia can lead to organ dysfunction and, ultimately, death. In the next chapter, we turn our attention to these regulatory systems: the renal system and the skin. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Anatomy of the Digestive System Intracellular digestion involves the oxidation of glucose and fatty acids to make energy. Extracellular digestion occurs in the lumen of the alimentary canal. Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large food particles into smaller food particles.
*$%pass: Chemical digestion is the enzymatic cleavage of chemical bonds, such as the peptide bonds of proteins or the glycosidic bonds of e pathway of the digestive tract is: oral cavity pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum e accessory organs of digestion are the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. e enteric nervous system is in the wall of the alimentary canal and controls peristalsis. Its activity is upregulated by the parasympathetic nervous system and downregulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Ingestion and Digestion Multiple hormones regulate feeding behavior, including antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) and aldosterone, which promote thirst; glucagon and ghrelin, which promote hunger; and leptin and cholecystokinin, which promote satiety. In the oral cavity, mastication starts the mechanical digestion of food, while salivary amylase and lipase start the chemical digestion of food. Food is formed into a bolus and swallowed. e pharynx connects the mouth and posterior nasal cavity to the e esophagus propels food to the stomach using peristalsis. Food enters the stomach through the lower esophageal (cardiac) sphincter. e stomach has four parts: fundus, body, antrum, and pylorus. e stomach has a lesser and greater curvature and is thrown into folds called rugae. Numerous secretory cells line the stomach. Mucous cells produce bicarbonate-rich mucus to protect the Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, a protease activated by the acidic environment of the stomach. Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption. G-cells secrete gastrin, a peptide hormone that increases HCl secretion and gastric motility. Aer mechanical and chemical digestion in the stomach, the food particles are now called chyme. Food passes into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter. e duodenum is the ﬁrst part of the small intestine and is primarily involved in chemical digestion.
*$%pass: Disaccharidases are brush-border enzymes that break down maltose, isomaltose, lactose, and sucrose into monosaccharides. Brush-border peptidases include aminopeptidase and dipeptidases. Enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen and procarboxypeptidases, initiating an activation cascade. Secretin stimulates the release of pancreatic juices into the digestive tract and slows motility. Cholecystokinin stimulates bile release from the gallbladder, release of pancreatic juices, and satiety. Accessory Organs of Digestion Acinar cells in the pancreas produce pancreatic juices that chymotrypsinogen, carboxypeptidases A and B), and pancreatic e liver synthesizes bile, which can be stored in the gallbladder or secreted into the duodenum directly. Bile emulsiﬁes fats, making them soluble and increasing their surface e main components of bile are bile salts, pigments (especially bilirubin from the breakdown of hemoglobin), and cholesterol. e liver also processes nutrients (through glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, storage and mobilization of fats, and gluconeogenesis), produces urea, detoxiﬁes chemicals, activates or inactivates medications, produces bile, and synthesizes albumin and clotting e gallbladder stores and concentrates bile. Absorption and Defecation e jejunum and ileum of the small intestine are primarily involved in e small intestine is lined with villi, which are covered with microvilli, increasing the surface area available for absorption. Villi contain a capillary bed and a lacteal, a vessel of the lymphatic Water-soluble compounds, such as monosaccharides, amino acids, water-soluble vitamins, small fatty acids, and water, enter the Fat-soluble compounds, such as fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins, enter the lacteal. e large intestine absorbs water and salts, forming semisolid feces. e cecum is an outpocketing that accepts ﬂuid from the small intestine through the ileocecal valve and is the site of attachment of e colon is divided into ascending, transverse, descending, and e rectum stores feces, which are then excreted through the anus. Gut bacteria produce vitamin K and biotin (vitamin B7). Answers to Concept Checks 1.
*$%pass: Mechanical digestion, such as chewing, physically breaks down food into smaller pieces. Chemical digestion involves hydrolysis of bonds and breakdown of food into smaller biomolecules. 2. Oral cavity (mouth) pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum anus 3. e parasympathetic nervous system increases secretions from all of the glands of the digestive system and promotes peristalsis. e sympathetic nervous system slows peristalsis. 1. Saliva contains salivary amylase (ptyalin), which digests starch into smaller sugars (maltose and dextrin); and lipase, which digests fats. Protects lining of stomach, increases pH (bicarbonate) Digests proteins, activated by H+ HCl: decreases pH, kills microbes, denatures proteins, carries out some chemical digestion; intrinsic factor: absorption of vitamin B12 Increases HCl production, increases gastric motility Brush-border enzyme; breaks down sucrose into Increases pancreatic secretions, especially bicarbonate; reduces HCl secretion; decreases motility Brush-border enzyme; breaks down dipeptides into free Recruits secretions from gallbladder and pancreas; Activates trypsinogen, which initiates an activation 4. Bile accomplishes mechanical digestion of fats, emulsifying them and increasing their surface area. Pancreatic lipase accomplishes chemical digestion of fats, breaking their ester bonds. 1. Carbohydrates: pancreatic amylase; proteins: trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidases A and B; fats: pancreatic lipase 2. Bile is composed of bile salts (amphipathic molecules derived from cholesterol that emulsify fats), pigments (especially bilirubin from the breakdown of hemoglobin), and cholesterol. 3. Bile is synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and serves its function in the duodenum. 4. e liver processes nutrients (through glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, storage and mobilization of fats, and gluconeogenesis), produces urea, detoxiﬁes chemicals, activates or inactivates medications, produces bile, and synthesizes albumin and clotting factors. 5. As outgrowths of the gut tube, the accessory organs of digestion arise from embryonic endoderm. 1. e two circulatory vessels are capillaries and lacteals.
*$%pass: e capillary absorbs water-soluble nutrients like monosaccharides, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids, water-soluble vitamins, and water itself. e lacteal absorbs fat-soluble nutrients, like fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble 2. e fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. 3. e small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. e large intestine consists of the cecum, colon, and rectum. 4. While the large intestine’s main function is to absorb water, the small intestine actually absorbs a much larger volume of water. us, massive volumes of watery diarrhea are more likely to arise from infections in the small intestine than in the large intestine. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, a protease secreted as a zymogen that is activated by the acidic environment of the stomach. G-cells secrete gastrin, parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, and mucous cells secrete alkaline mucus, eliminating the other answer choices. e small intestine is divided into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. e cecum is part of the large intestine, making (B) the correct answer. Aminopeptidase is a brush-border peptidase secreted by the cells lining the duodenum; it does not require enteropeptidase for activation. Both trypsinogen and procarboxypeptidases A and B are activated by enteropeptidase, eliminating (A) and (D). Once activated, trypsin can activate chymotrypsinogen; if trypsinogen cannot be activated, then chymotrypsinogen will not be activated either, eliminating (C). Lipase is involved in the digestion of fats, but its function is not to emulsify fats—this is the job of bile. Rather, lipase chemically digests fats in the duodenum, allowing them to be brought into duodenal cells and packaged into chylomicrons. e other associations given here are all Protein digestion begins in the stomach, where pepsin (secreted as pepsinogen) hydrolyzes speciﬁc peptide bonds.
*$%pass: Protein digestion continues in the small intestine as trypsin (secreted as trypsinogen), chymotrypsin (secreted as chymotrypsinogen), carboxypeptidases A and B (secreted as procarboxypeptidases A and B), aminopeptidase, and dipeptidases hydrolyze speciﬁc parts of the peptide. No protein digestion occurs in the mouth or large intestine. Sucrase is a brush-border enzyme found on duodenal cells and is not secreted by the salivary glands. is enzyme hydrolyzes sucrose (a disaccharide) to form glucose and fructose (monosaccharides). e other associations are all correct. e question is basically asking us to identify the structure that lies between the stomach and the small intestine. is is the pyloric sphincter; the presentation given in the question is a classic example of what is called pyloric stenosis, in which the pyloric sphincter is thickened and cannot relax to permit chyme through. e cardiac sphincter, (A), lies between the esophagus and the stomach. e ileocecal valve, (C), lies between the ileum of the small intestine and the cecum of the large intestine. e internal anal sphincter, (D), lies at the end of e parasympathetic nervous system has many roles in the digestive system. It promotes motility of the gut tube and secretion from glands. erefore, blocking the parasympathetic nervous system would likely result in dry mouth (from reduced secretion of saliva), slow gastric emptying (from decreased peristalsis), and decreased gastric acid production (from reduced HCl secretion from the parietal cells in the gastric glands), eliminating (A), (C), and (D). (B) is the correct answer because we would expect constipation in such an individual, not diarrhea: slowed motility through the colon would lead to increased water reabsorption, making the feces too ﬁrm and causing constipation. e ﬁrst graph shows maximal activity at a very acidic pH, implying that this is an enzyme acting in the stomach.
*$%pass: e second graph shows maximal activity around pH 8.5, implying that this is an enzyme acting in the duodenum. e only choice that matches the ﬁrst graph with a stomach enzyme (pepsin) and the second with a duodenal enzyme (carboxypeptidase B) is (B). Elevated bilirubin implies a blockage to bile ﬂow, increased production of bilirubin (from massive hemoglobin release), or an inability of the liver to produce bile. If the bile duct were occluded, as in (A), then bile would not be able to ﬂow into the digestive tract and would build up, increasing bilirubin levels in the blood. If many red blood cells were lysed, as in (B), then bilirubin levels would rise in accordance with the increased hemoglobin release. If liver failure occurred, as in (D), then the liver would be unable to produce bile, and bilirubin would again build up. (C) refers to a pathology in the stomach—the key word given here is rugae, which are the folds in the stomach wall. Lack of gastric function would have no eﬀect on bilirubin levels, making this the correct choice. Chylomicrons contain triacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, and fat-soluble vitamins and are secreted by intestinal cells into lacteals. Amino acids, fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamins A and E), and cholesterol are all absorbed in the small intestine. e cleavage of a fat described in this question stem refers to the breakdown of triacylglycerides, which is a hydrolysis reaction in which water is added across the ester linkage of the fatty acids to the glycerol backbone, breaking these bonds. For this reason, chemical digestion, (B), is correct. Note that, the location of this reaction occurs in the lumen of a digestive organ, so this reaction could also be classiﬁed as an extracellular reaction. is observation is important because it eliminates (C).
*$%pass: While the capillaries from the intestine come together to form the portal vein, which drains to the liver, the lacteals come together to form the thoracic duct, which drains directly into the le subclavian vein. erefore, fat-soluble compounds do not pass through the liver before reaching the right side of the heart. Only (A), vitamin D, is fat-soluble. Ghrelin promotes a sensation of hunger, increasing feeding behavior. Both leptin and cholecystokinin promote satiety, decreasing feeding behavior—eliminating (A) and (B). Gastrin increases acid production and gastric motility, but does not have any signiﬁcant relationship with feeding behavior, eliminating (D). e liver serves many functions, including carrying out metabolic processes (glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, fat storage, and gluconeogenesis), detoxiﬁcation or activation of medications, and synthesis of bile. Germane to this question are the roles of converting ammonia into urea through the urea cycle and synthesis of proteins, including albumin and clotting factors. A patient with liver failure would thus not be able to convert ammonia into urea and would have high concentrations of ammonia and low concentrations of urea in the blood, eliminating (A) and (C). With decreased synthetic activity, both albumin and clotting factor concentrations would be low, eliminating (B) and making (D) the correct answer.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems Have a headache? Take an ibuprofen. Backache?
*$%pass: Works for that, too. Ibuprofen, which has been around for over 50 years, is a relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID). Ibuprofen is known as an analgesic, or pain reliever. When used in moderation, ibuprofen carries relatively little risk. However, taking multiple doses for many years can profoundly aﬀect the kidneys. Years of analgesic use (usually as self-therapy) can lead to kidney failure, known as analgesic nephropathy. If untreated, kidney failure is universally fatal. If kidney failure is detected, however, dialysis (or a kidney transplant) could save an individual’s life. How does dialysis save a patient with kidney failure? Dialyzing ﬂuid has many of the same solutes as blood, in strategic concentrations, and it is kept separate from blood by a semipermeable membrane. As blood is ﬁltered through the dialysis machine, ﬂuid and solutes diﬀuse down their concentration gradients, limited only by size (as determined by the membrane). e dialysis machine therefore performs ﬁltration to purify the blood and excrete wastes, a crucial function that the kidneys would normally perform. In this chapter, we’ll learn more about ﬁltration, as well as reabsorption and secretion. ese processes are collectively responsible for osmoregulation. Osmoregulation is just one mechanism the body uses to maintain homeostasis in its ﬂuids and tissues. We’ll also discuss the skin, which plays a signiﬁcant role in temperature homeostasis (thermoregulation).
*$%pass: The Excretory System After Chapter 10.1, you will be able to: List the structures of the secretory pathway Order the vessels in the renal vascular pathway Identify the nervous system components used to control the detrusor muscle Describe the processes by which components of the kidney are able to exchange solutes between the filtrate and the blood Identify the function(s) of each segment of the nephron: e excretory system serves many functions, including the regulation of blood pressure, blood osmolarity, acid–base balance, and removal of nitrogenous wastes. e kidneys play an essential role in these functions. Anatomy of the Excretory System e excretory system consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, as shown in Figure 10.1. e kidneys are two bean-shaped structures located behind the digestive organs at the level of the bottom rib. e functional unit of the kidney is the nephron; each kidney has approximately 1 million nephrons. All of the nephrons eventually empty into the renal pelvis, which narrows to form the the ureter. Urine travels through the ureter to the bladder. From the bladder, urine is transported through the urethra to exit Figure 10.1 The Excretory System Once it leaves the kidneys, urine moves through the ureters to be stored in the urinary bladder until it is excreted through the urethra. Each kidney is subdivided into a cortex and a medulla, as shown in Figure 10.2. e cortex is the kidney’s outermost layer, while the medulla of the kidney sits within the cortex. Each kidney also has a renal hilum, which is a deep slit in the center of its medial surface. e widest part of the ureter, the renal pelvis, spans almost the entire width of the renal hilum. e renal artery, renal vein, and ureter enter and exit through the renal hilum.
*$%pass: Figure 10.2 Gross Anatomy of the Kidney The portal system in the kidney is one of three major portal systems in the body. The other two are the hypophyseal portal system, which connects the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary (discussed in Chapter 5 of MCAT Biology Review), and the hepatic portal system, which connects the gut tube and the liver (discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT Biology Review). In each case, blood passes through two capillary beds before returning to the e kidney has one of the few portal systems in the body. A portal system consists of two capillary beds in series through which blood must travel before returning to the heart. e renal artery branches out, passes through the medulla, and enters the cortex as aﬀerent arterioles. e highly convoluted capillary tus derived from these aﬀerent arterioles are known as glomeruli. Aer blood passes through a glomerulus, the eﬀerent arterioles then form a second capillary bed. ese capillaries surround the loop of Henle and are known as vasa recta. e renal vascular system is shown in Figure 10.3 Microanatomy of the Renal Vascular System and the Nephron Also visible in Figure 10.3 is the structure of the nephron. Around the glomerulus is a cup-like structure known as Bowman’s capsule. Bowman’s capsule leads to a long tubule with many distinct areas; in order, these are the proximal convoluted tubule, descending and ascending limbs of the Loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. e kidney’s ability to excrete waste is intricately tied to the speciﬁc placement of these structures and their physiology. Our discussion of neurons in Chapter 4 of MCAT Biology Review used some of the same terms as those that describe the organization of blood vessels in the kidney.
*$%pass: Afferent neurons carry sensory information toward the central nervous system much as afferent arterioles carry blood toward the glomeruli. Efferent neurons relay signals away from the central nervous system just as efferent arterioles carry blood away from the glomerulus. e bladder has a muscular lining known as the detrusor muscle. Parasympathetic activity causes the detrusor muscle to contract. However, in order to leave the body, urine must pass through two sphincters—the internal and external urethral sphincters. e internal urethral sphincter, consisting of smooth muscle, is contracted in its normal state. Because the internal sphincter is made of smooth muscle, it is under involuntary control. e external urethral sphincter consists of skeletal muscle and is under voluntary control. When the bladder is full, stretch receptors convey to the nervous system that the bladder requires emptying. is causes parasympathetic neurons to ﬁre, and the detrusor muscle contracts. is contraction also causes the internal sphincter to relax. is reﬂex is known as the micturition reﬂex. e next step is up to the individual. e person can choose to relax the external sphincter to urinate, or can maintain the tone of the external sphincter to prevent urination. is can cause a few moments of discomfort, but the reﬂex usually dissipates in a few minutes. However, if the bladder is not emptied, then the process will begin anew shortly thereaer. Urination itself is facilitated by the contraction of the abdominal musculature, which increases pressure within the abdominal cavity, resulting in compression of the bladder and increased urine ﬂow rate. e kidney ﬁlters the blood to form urine. e composition and quantity of urine is determined by the present state of the body.
*$%pass: For example, if blood volume is low and blood osmolarity is high, then it is most beneﬁcial to the body to maximally retain water. is results in low-volume, highly concentrated urine. Likewise, a patient receiving large amounts of intravenous ﬂuids is likely to produce a larger volume of less concentrated urine. us, the primary job of the kidneys is to regulate blood volume and osmolarity. In order to do this, kidney function may be divided into three diﬀerent processes: ﬁltration, secretion, and reabsorption. e nephron’s ﬁrst function is ﬁltration. In the kidneys, approximately 20 percent of the blood that passes through the glomerulus is ﬁltered as ﬂuid into Bowman’s space. e collected ﬂuid is known as the ﬁltrate. e movement of ﬂuid into Bowman’s space is governed by Starling forces, which account for the pressure diﬀerentials in both hydrostatic and oncotic pressures between the blood and Bowman’s space, as shown in Figure 10.4. e hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus is signiﬁcantly higher than that in Bowman’s space, which causes ﬂuid to move into the nephron. On the other hand, the osmolarity of blood is higher than that of Bowman’s space, resulting in pressure opposing the movement of ﬂuid into the nephron. However, the hydrostatic pressure is much larger than the oncotic pressure, so the net ﬂow is still from blood into the nephron. Figure 10.4 Starling Forces The relative hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients determine the direction and rate Like the electromotive force discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Physics and Math Review, Starling forces are really a misnomer. Rather than forces, it is a pressure differential that causes the net movement of fluid from the glomerulus to Bowman’s space. Pressure is discussed in Chapter 4 of MCAT Physics and Math Review.
*$%pass: Under most circumstances, ﬂuid will ﬂow from the glomerulus into Bowman’s space. However, various pathologies can cause derangements of this ﬂow. Consider what might happen if the ureter was obstructed by a kidney stone. An obstruction would result in a buildup of urine behind the stone. Eventually, enough ﬂuid will build up and cause distention of the renal pelvis and the nephrons. What will happen to ﬁltration in this case? e hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space would increase to the point that ﬁltration could no longer occur because there would be excessive pressure opposing movement of ﬂuid into the nephron. e ﬁltrate is similar in composition to blood but does not contain cells or proteins due to the ﬁlter’s ability to select based on size. In other words, molecules or cells that are larger than glomerular pores will remain in the blood. As described earlier, the blood remaining in the glomerulus then travels into the eﬀerent arterioles, which empty into the vasa recta. e ﬁltrate is isotonic to blood so that neither the capsule nor the capillaries swell. Our kidneys ﬁlter about 180 liters per day, which is approximately 36 times our blood volume. is means that the entire volume of a person’s blood is ﬁltered about every 40 minutes. Imagine that the glomerulus is like a sieve or colander. Small molecules dissolved in the blood will pass through the tiny pores (such as glucose, which is later reabsorbed), whereas large molecules such as proteins and blood cells will not. If blood cells or proteins are found in the urine, this indicates a health problem at the level of the glomerulus. In addition to ﬁltering blood, the nephrons are able to secrete salts, acids, bases, and urea directly into the tubule by either active or passive transport.
*$%pass: e quantity and identity of the substances secreted into the nephron are directly related to the needs of the body at that time. For example, a diet heavy in meat results in the intake of large amounts of protein, which contains a signiﬁcant amount of nitrogen. Ammonia (NH3) is a byproduct of the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds and, as a base, can disturb the pH of blood and cells. e liver converts the ammonia to urea, a neutral compound, which travels to the kidney and is secreted into the nephron for excretion in the urine. e kidneys are capable of eliminating ions or other substances when present in relative excess in the blood, such as potassium cations, hydrogen ions, or metabolites of medications. Secretion is also a mechanism for excreting wastes that are simply too large to pass through glomerular pores. Filtration: movement of solutes from blood to filtrate at Bowman’s capsule Secretion: movement of solutes from blood to filtrate anywhere besides Bowman’s Reabsorption: movement of solutes from filtrate to blood Some compounds that are ﬁltered or secreted may be taken back up for use via reabsorption. Certain substances are almost always reabsorbed, such as glucose, amino acids, and vitamins. In addition, hormones such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) and aldosterone can alter the quantity of water reabsorbed within the kidney in order to maintain blood e kidney uses mechanisms such as ﬁltration, secretion, and reabsorption to produce urine and to regulate the blood volume and osmolarity. However, the function of the nephron isn’t quite that simple.
*$%pass: In fact, renal physiology is oen considered one of the most diﬃcult topics covered in medical In order to simplify this topic, it is important to understand that the kidney has two main goals: keep what the body needs and lose what it doesn’t, and concentrate the urine to conserve water. e kidney allows the human body to reabsorb certain materials for reuse, while also selectively eliminating waste. For example, glucose and amino acids are not usually present in the urine because the kidney is able to reabsorb these substances for later use. On the contrary, waste products like hydrogen and potassium ions, ammonia, and urea remain in the ﬁltrate and are excreted. Finally, water is reabsorbed in large quantities in order to maintain blood pressure and Anything that makes it into the filtrate and that is not reabsorbed will be lost from the body in In order to understand this complex organ, we will study the nephron piece- by-piece, discussing exactly what is occurring in each segment. Follow along with the nephron diagram shown in Figure 10.5. As a theme, note that segments that are horizontal in the diagram (Bowman’s capsule, the proximal convoluted tubule, and the distal convoluted tubule) are primarily focused on the identity of the particles in the urine (keep what the body needs and lose what it doesn’t). In contrast, the segments that are vertical in the diagram (the loop of Henle and collecting duct) are primarily focused on the volume and concentration of the urine (concentrate the urine to conserve Figure 10.5 Reabsorption and Secretion in the Nephron Proximal Convoluted Tubule e ﬁltrate ﬁrst enters the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). In this region, amino acids, glucose, water-soluble vitamins, and the majority of salts are reabsorbed along with water.
*$%pass: Almost 70 percent of ﬁltered sodium will be reabsorbed here, but the ﬁltrate remains isotonic to the interstitium, as other solutes and a large volume of water are also reabsorbed. Solutes that enter the interstitium—the connective tissue surrounding the nephron— are picked up by the vasa recta to be returned to the bloodstream for reuse within the body. e PCT is also the site of secretion for a number of waste products, including hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonia, and urea. Major waste products excreted in the urine: Dump the HUNK Loop of Henle Filtrate from the proximal convoluted tubule then enters the descending limb of the loop of Henle, which dives deep into the medulla before turning around to become the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. e descending limb is permeable only to water, and the medulla has an ever-increasing osmolarity as the descending limb travels deeper into it. ink for a moment how this would aﬀect the ﬂow of water. As the descending limb traverses deeper into the medulla, the increasing interstitial concentration favors the outﬂow of water from the descending limb, which is reabsorbed into the e kidney is capable of altering the osmolarity of the interstitium. is creates a gradient that, coupled with selective permeability of the nephron, allows maximal reabsorption and conservation of water. In the normal physiological state, the osmolarity in the cortex is approximately the same as that of the blood and remains at that level. Deeper in the medulla, the osmolarity in the interstitium can range from isotonic with blood (when trying to excrete water) to four times as concentrated (when trying to conserve water).
*$%pass: If the concentration is the same in the tubule and in the interstitium, there is no driving force (gradient), and the water will be lost in urine. If the interstitium is more concentrated, then water will move out of the tubule, into the interstitium, and eventually back into the blood. Together, the vasa recta and nephron create a countercurrent multiplier system. is means that the ﬂow of ﬁltrate through the loop of Henle is in the opposite direction from the ﬂow of blood through the vasa recta. If the two ﬂowed in the same direction, they would quickly reach equilibrium and the kidney would be unable to reabsorb as much water. By making the two ﬂow in opposite directions, the ﬁltrate is constantly being exposed to hypertonic blood, which allows maximal reabsorption of water. As the descending limb transitions to become the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, a change in permeability occurs. e ascending limb is only permeable to salts and is impermeable to water. So while the descending limb maximizes water reabsorption by taking advantage of increasing medullary osmolarity, the ascending limb maximizes salt reabsorption by taking advantage of decreasing medullary osmolarity. At the transition from the inner to outer medulla, the loop of Henle becomes thicker in what is termed the diluting segment. is is not because the lumen within the tube has enlarged, but because the cells lining the tube are larger. ese cells contain large amounts of mitochondria, which allow the reabsorption of sodium and chloride by active transport. Indeed, because so much salt is reabsorbed while water is stuck in the nephron, the ﬁltrate actually becomes hypotonic compared to the interstitium.
*$%pass: While we tend to focus on the concentrating abilities of the nephron, this segment is noteworthy because it is the only portion of the nephron that can produce urine that is more dilute than the blood. is is important during periods of overhydration and provides a mechanism for eliminating excess water. At the beginning of the loop of Henle, the ﬁltrate is isotonic to the interstitium. us, from the beginning of the loop of Henle to the end, there is a slight degree of dilution. Far more important, however, is the fact that the volume of the ﬁltrate has been signiﬁcantly reduced, demonstrating a net reabsorption of a large volume of water. Distal Convoluted Tubule Next, the ﬁltrate enters the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). e DCT responds to aldosterone, which promotes sodium reabsorption. Because sodium ions are osmotically active particles, water will follow the sodium, concentrating the urine and decreasing its volume. e DCT is also a site of waste product secretion, like the PCT. In certain conditions, such as congestive heart failure, the body accumulates excess fluid in the lungs or peripheral tissues (edema). The judicious use of a diuretic drug can help the body get rid of excess fluid. Diuretics typically inhibit the reabsorption of sodium in one or more regions of the nephron, thereby increasing sodium excretion. As an osmotically active particle, sodium will pull water with it, thereby relieving the body of some of its excess fluid. e ﬁnal concentration of the urine will depend largely on the permeability of the collecting duct, which is responsive to both aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin). As permeability of the collecting duct increases, so too does water reabsorption, resulting in further concentration of the urine.
*$%pass: e reabsorbed water enters the interstitium and makes its way to the vasa recta, where it reenters the bloodstream to once again become part of the plasma. e collecting duct almost always reabsorbs water, but the amount is variable. When the body is very well hydrated, the collecting duct will be fairly impermeable to salt and water. When in conservation mode, ADH and aldosterone will each act to increase reabsorption of water in the collecting duct, allowing for greater water retention and more concentrated urine output. Ultimately, anything that is not reabsorbed from the tubule by the end of the collecting duct will be excreted; the collecting duct is the point of no return. Aer that, there are no further opportunities for reabsorption. As the ﬁltrate leaves the tubule, it collects in the renal pelvis. e ﬂuid, which carries mostly urea, uric acid, and excess ions (sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), ﬂows through the ureter to the bladder where it is stored until Functions of the Excretory System e kidneys use osmolarity gradients and selective permeability to ﬁlter, secrete, and reabsorb materials in the process of making urine. However, these processes have larger implications for the human body as a whole. e selective elimination of water and solutes allows the kidneys, in conjunction with the endocrine, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, to control blood pressure, blood osmolarity, and acid–base balance. In Chapter 5 of MCAT Biology Review, we discussed two hormones that are very important for the maintenance of proper blood pressure: aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin). Aldosterone increases blood pressure by increasing the reabsorption of sodium. In medicine, we exploit this characteristic by using drugs that actually block angiotensin- converting enzyme or the angiotensin II receptor.
*$%pass: In Chapter 5 of MCAT Biology Review, we mentioned the ACE inhibitors, which mostly end with –pril. The angiotensin II receptor blockers mostly end with –sartan (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan). Blocking this receptor limits aldosterone release, which limits salt and water reabsorption, and therefore results in lowered blood pressure. Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that is secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to decreased blood pressure. Decreased blood pressure stimulates the release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. Renin then cleaves angiotensinogen, a liver protein, to form angiotensin I. is peptide is then metabolized by angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lungs to form angiotensin II, which promotes the release of aldosterone from the adrenal ADH only governs water reabsorption and thus results in a lower blood osmolarity. Aldosterone causes both salt and water reabsorption and does not change blood Aldosterone works by altering the ability of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to reabsorb sodium. Remember that water does not move on its own, but rather travels down its osmolarity gradient. us, if we reabsorb more sodium, water will ﬂow with it. is reabsorption of isotonic ﬂuid has the net eﬀect of increasing blood volume and therefore blood pressure. Aldosterone will also increase potassium and hydrogen ion excretion. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) is a peptide hormone synthesized by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary in response to high blood osmolarity. It directly alters the permeability of the collecting duct, allowing more water to be reabsorbed by making the cell junctions of the duct leaky. Increased concentration in the interstitium (hypertonic to the ﬁltrate) will then cause the reabsorption of water from the tubule. Alcohol and caﬀeine both inhibit ADH release and lead to the frequent excretion of dilute urine.
*$%pass: In addition to the kidneys, the cardiovascular system also regulates blood pressure, speciﬁcally by vasoconstricting or vasodilating in order to maintain blood pressure. Constriction of the aﬀerent arteriole will lead to a lower pressure of blood reaching the glomeruli, which are adjacent to the juxtaglomerular cells. erefore, this vasoconstriction will secondarily lead to renin release, which will also help raise blood pressure. e osmolarity of the blood must be tightly controlled to ensure correct oncotic pressures within the vasculature. A note on terminology: osmotic pressure is the “sucking” pressure that draws water into the vasculature caused by all dissolved particles. Oncotic pressure, on the other hand, is the osmotic pressure that is attributable to dissolved proteins speciﬁcally. Blood osmolarity is usually maintained at approximately 290 milliosmoles (mOsm) per liter. As described earlier, the kidneys control osmolarity by modulating the reabsorption of water and by ﬁltering and secreting dissolved particles. When blood osmolarity is low, excess water will be excreted, while solutes will be reabsorbed in higher concentrations. In contrast, when blood osmolarity is high, water reabsorption increases and solute excretion e bicarbonate buﬀer system is the major regulator of blood pH. Remind yourself of the buﬀer equation: In Chapter 6 of MCAT Biology Review, we talked about how the respiratory system can contribute to acid–base balance by increasing or decreasing the respiratory rate. If the blood pH is too low, then increasing the respiratory rate blows oﬀ more CO2 and favors the conversion of H+ and and carbon dioxide, increasing the pH. If the blood pH is too high, then decreasing the respiratory rate causes the opposite eﬀects. e respiratory system can react to derangements of pH quickly. What can the excretory system do to contribute?
*$%pass: e kidneys are able to selectively increase or decrease the secretion of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate. When blood pH is too low, the kidneys excrete more hydrogen ions and increase reabsorption of bicarbonate, resulting in a higher pH. Likewise, when blood pH is too high, the kidneys can excrete more bicarbonate and increase the reabsorption of hydrogen ions. is is slower than the respiratory response, but it is a highly eﬀective way for the body to maintain acid–base balance. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Carbonic anhydrases are a group of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into carbonic acid, which in solution rapidly dissociates into bicarbonate and a proton. The second isoform, carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) is soluble and is expressed in most tissues including red blood cells, osteoclasts, and the kidney. CAII physically and functionally interacts CA = enzyme that catalyzes CO2 into bicarbonate ion CAII isoform is expressed in most with aquaporin-1 (AQP1) to increase permeability of AQP1 to water. AQP1 is expressed in the lumen facing and the interstitium facing membranes of the proximal tubule, as well as the thin descending limb (TDL) of the loop of Henle. Our observation that CAII augments water flux through AQP1 led us to posit that CAII may contribute to water reabsorption and consequently to urinary concentrating ability. To test this hypothesis, we examined water homeostasis in CAII-deficient (CAII def) mice. These mice were found to be polydipsic (high water intake) and polyuric (high urine volume). Analysis of the osmolarity of the urine is seen in Figure 1.
*$%pass: We also measured the following properties in the interstitium of the renal cortex, inner strip of the outer medulla (ISOM), which lies between the cortex and the medulla, and the inner medulla (IM): osmolarity (Figure 2) and sodium ion concentration (Figure 3). *Represents p <0.05 CAII interacts with AQP1 more APQ1 is found in the proximal convoluted tubule and descending limb of loop of Henle Hypothesis: CAII helps with water resorption and concentrating Knocked out CAII in mice, looked at water homeostasis CAII-def mice drank lots of water, had high volume of urine Fig 1: urine osmolarity Looked at three different kidney areas: cortex, between cortex and medulla, and medulla Fig 2: osmolarity in three kidney Fig 3: sodium ion concentration in three kidney regions IV: wild-type or CAII-def mice DV: urine osmolarity Trend: CAII-def mice have significantly lower urine IV: region of kidney, type of mice (WT or CAII-def) DV: interstitium osmolarity Trend: inner medulla of kidney interstitium has significantly lower osmolarity in CAII-def mice compared to WT IV: region of kidney, type of mice (WT or CAII-def) DV: interstitium sodium Trend: inner medulla of kidney interstitium has significantly lower sodium concentration in CAII-def mice compared to WT Adapted from Krishnan, D., Pan, W., Beggs, M. R., Trepiccione, F., Chambrey, R., Eladari, D., Cordat, E., Dimke, H., . . . Alexander, R. T. (2018). Deﬁciency of carbonic anhydrase II results in a urinary concentrating defect. Frontiers in Physiology, 8, 1108. According to the data, lack of CAII has the greatest impact on which portion of the nephron? Since the question is asking us to use the data to pinpoint a speciﬁc area of the nephron being aﬀected, it’s important to understand the experimental setup and the results, and to be prepared to use our outside content knowledge.
*$%pass: e researcher’s goal is to better understand the role CAII plays in water resorption through its interaction with AQP1. We should know from our content background that aquaporin (AQP) is a water-speciﬁc membrane channel found in many parts of the nephron, and AQP availability on the membrane allows for movement of water from the ﬁltrate back into the body. We’re also given some information about CAII— it’s the enzyme responsible for creating bicarbonate ions, and we’re told it interacts with AQP1 to increase water permeability. In creating mice with deﬁcient CAII, the researchers are looking for a change in the osmolarity of the urine and the kidney. We’re told in paragraph 2 that the CAII-deﬁcient mice have a high urine volume and high water intake, supporting the hypothesis that the mice are not reabsorbing enough water, but instead are excreting it as urine. Figure 1 also supports this conclusion by showing that urine is more dilute in CAII-deﬁcient mice than in wild-type (controls). However, this data doesn’t answer the question of where speciﬁcally in the nephron lack of CAII is having the greatest impact. Figures 2 and 3 both have information about speciﬁc parts of the kidney, which is where our answer is going to come from. Recall that cortex refers to the outer region of the organ, while medulla refers to the inner part. We’re given an additional area called the ISOM, which is the boundary between the cortex and medulla. We can see from those two ﬁgures that the osmolarity of the interstitium in the inner medulla (IM) is signiﬁcantly lower than in normal mice, indicating that the part of the nephron existing in the inner medulla is the problem area.
*$%pass: Paragraph 1 states that AQP1 is found in the proximal tubule and the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle. e proximal tubule would be in the outer part of the kidney in the cortex, and the thin descending limb would go deep into the kidney, moving into the inner medulla, making the descending limb the part of the nephron that is being most aﬀected. While this satisﬁes the requirements of the question, this brings up another issue: why does less water being reabsorbed into the interstitium result in less osmolarity? Shouldn’t the expected result be a higher osmolarity? is ultimately comes down to how the nephron works as a whole to concentrate your urine. Lack of water being reabsorbed by the thin descending limb will result in a decrease of ions being passively reabsorbed in the ascending limb, giving us that drop in osmolarity. Using the results of the data, we can conclude that the CAII-deﬁcient mice are being most impacted by the reduced eﬃcacy of AQP1 in the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle.

It makes up about 16 percent of total body weight, on average. Skin is one of the major components of nonspeciﬁc immune defense, protecting us from exposure to the elements and invasion by pathogens. e skin has several layers. Starting from the deepest layer and working outward, these layers are the hypodermis (subcutaneous layer), dermis, and epidermis, as shown in Figure 10.6. Skin is derived from the ectoderm. Figure 10.6 Anatomy of the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue e epidermis is also subdivided into layers called strata. From the deepest layer outward, these are the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum, as shown in Figure 10.7. e stratum basale contains stem cells and is responsible for proliferation of keratinocytes, the predominant cells of the skin, that produce keratin. In the stratum spinosum, these cells become connected to each other; this layer is also the site of Langerhans cells, described below. In the stratum granulosum, the keratinocytes die and lose their nuclei. e stratum lucidum is only present in thick, hairless skin, such as the skin on the sole of the foot or the palms, and is nearly transparent. Finally, the stratum corneum contains up to several dozen layers of ﬂattened keratinocytes, forming a barrier that prevents invasion by pathogens and that helps to prevent loss of ﬂuids and salt.
*$%pass: Hair projects above the skin, and there are openings for sweat and sebaceous glands. Figure 10.7 Layers of the Epidermis Other Cells of the Epidermis In the epidermis, the main cells are keratinocytes. Keratin, mentioned above, is resistant to damage and provides protection against injury, water, and pathogens. Calluses form from excessive keratin deposition in areas of repeated strain due to friction; they provide protection to avoid damage in the future. Fingernails and hair are also formed from keratin and are produced by specialized cells in the skin. Layers of the skin (superficial to deep): Come, Let’s Get Sun Burned Melanocytes are a cell type derived from neural crest cells and found in the stratum basale. ese cells produce melanin, a pigment that serves to protect the skin from DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. Once produced, the pigment is transferred to the keratinocytes. All humans actually have comparable numbers of melanocytes; skin color is caused by varying levels of activity of the melanocytes. More active melanocytes result in darker skin tones. Upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation, melanocytes increase activity, resulting in a darker skin color. People who have albinism suffer from a genetic metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to synthesize melanin. Typically, albinism is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. As would be expected, patients with albinism are extremely sensitive to the harmful effects of the sun. Depigmentation can also occur in vitiligo, an autoimmune disorder in which melanocytes are killed by the individual’s immune system. Langerhans cells are actually special macrophages that reside within the stratum spinosum. ese cells are capable of presenting antigens to T-cells in order to activate the immune system. e dermis also consists of multiple layers. e upper layer (right below the epidermis) is the papillary layer, which consists of loose connective tissue.
*$%pass: Below the papillary layer is the denser reticular layer. Sweat glands, blood vessels, and hair follicles originate in the dermis. Evaporation is an endothermic process and, thus, substances absorb energy from the surroundings to undergo this phase change. Further, the presence of dissolved solutes in sweat increases the boiling point of sweat slightly in comparison to pure water; this allows the absorption of even more heat energy. Boiling point elevation is a colligative property that is discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT General Chemistry Review. Most sensory receptors are also located in the dermis. Merkel cells (discs), for example, are sensory receptors present at the epidermal–dermal junction. ese cells are connected to sensory neurons and are responsible for deep pressure and texture sensation within the skin. Other sensory organs in the skin include free nerve endings, which respond to pain; Meissner’s corpuscles, which respond to light touch; Ruﬃni endings, which respond to stretch; and Pacinian corpuscles, which respond to deep pressure and vibration. Finally, the hypodermis is a layer of connective tissue that connects the skin to the rest of the body. is layer contains fat and ﬁbrous tissue. We have already mentioned that the skin protects us from the elements and microbes. It also has other functions, including ultraviolet protection (via melanin) and transduction of sensory information from the outside world. In this section, we look at another function of the skin: thermoregulation. ermoregulation is achieved by sweating, piloerection, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction. Sweating is an excellent cooling mechanism that is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. When body temperature rises above the set point determined by the hypothalamus, thermoregulation processes must occur in order to rid the body of heat.
*$%pass: Postganglionic sympathetic neurons that utilize acetylcholine innervate sweat glands and promote the secretion of water with certain ions onto the skin. Heat is then absorbed from the body as the water molecules undergo a phase change to evaporate. e production of sweat itself is not the main mechanism of cooling; it is the evaporation of water from the skin which absorbs body heat. At the same time, arteriolar vasodilation occurs to maximize heat loss. is brings a large quantity of blood to the skin, which accelerates the evaporation of sweat by maximizing the heat energy available for the liquid– gas phase change. The neurons that innervate sweat glands are actually very unusual. Unlike all other postganglionic sympathetic neurons, these neurons are cholinergic—not noradrenergic (that is, they release acetylcholine, not norepinephrine). All preganglionic neurons in the autonomic nervous system and postganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic nervous system are cholinergic as well. These neurons are discussed in Chapter 4 of MCAT Biology In cold conditions, arrector pili muscles contract, causing the hairs of the skin to stand up on end (piloerection). is helps to trap a layer of heated air near the skin. e arterioles that feed the capillaries of the skin constrict, limiting the quantity of blood reaching the skin. Skeletal muscle may also begin to contract rapidly, causing shivering. Shivering requires a sizeable amount of ATP; however, a signiﬁcant portion of the energy from ATP is converted into thermal energy. In addition to these mechanisms, humans possess a layer of fat just below the skin. is fat helps to insulate the body. In addition to this fat, which is called white fat, brown fat may also be present, especially in infants.
*$%pass: Brown fat has a much less eﬃcient electron transport chain, which means that more heat energy is released as fuel is e skin also helps to maintain the osmolarity of the body. is is because the skin is relatively impermeable to water. is prevents not only the entrance of water through the skin, but also the loss of water from the tissues. is becomes very important in cases such as burns or large losses of skin as dehydration of the tissues becomes a real threat to survival. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 10.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What is the predominant cell type in the epidermis? 2. What are the layers of the epidermis, from superficial to deep? 3. What are the layers of the dermis, from superficial to deep? 4. What are some mechanisms the body uses to cool itself? What are some mechanisms the body uses to retain heat? Two main organ systems were discussed in this chapter: the excretory system and the skin. Both of these systems play an essential role in homeostasis. However, this chapter also demonstrated a very MCAT-worthy concept: no system works alone. Multiple systems participate in homeostasis. While the kidneys are the major players in salt, water, and acid–base balance, their function depends on the endocrine system, circulatory system, and respiratory system. While the skin is an important immune organ in and of itself, its function as a thermoregulatory organ is dependent on the nervous system—and it also sends sensory signals to the nervous system. As you move on to the last organ system in the next chapter —the musculoskeletal system—notice how each system interacts with other systems in order to produce a fully functioning organism.
*$%pass: e MCAT is far more focused on how you conceptualize the big picture, and not on how many details you memorize. As you study, focus on understanding these systems and how each system inﬂuences the rest of the body. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online The Excretory System e excretory system serves many functions, including the regulation of blood pressure, blood osmolarity, acid–base balance, and removal of e kidney produces urine, which ﬂows into the ureter at the renal pelvis. Urine is then collected in the bladder until it is excreted through the urethra. e kidney contains a cortex and a medulla. Each kidney has a hilum, which contains a renal artery, renal vein, and ureter. e kidney contains a portal system with two capillary beds in series. Blood from the renal artery ﬂows into aﬀerent arterioles, which form glomeruli in Bowman’s capsule (the ﬁrst capillary bed). Blood then ﬂows through the eﬀerent arteriole to the vasa recta (the second capillary bed), which surround the nephron, before leaving the kidney through the renal vein. e bladder has a muscular lining known as the detrusor muscle, which is under parasympathetic control. It also has two muscular e internal urethral sphincter consists of smooth muscle and is under involuntary (parasympathetic) control. e external urethral sphincter consists of skeletal muscle and is under voluntary control. e kidney participates in solute movement through three processes: Filtration is the movement of solutes from blood to ﬁltrate at Bowman’s capsule. e direction and rate of ﬁltration is determined by Starling forces, which account for the hydrostatic and oncotic pressure diﬀerentials between the glomerulus and Bowman’s space. Secretion is the movement of solutes from blood to ﬁltrate anywhere other than Bowman’s capsule.
*$%pass: Reabsorption is the movement of solutes from ﬁltrate to blood. Each segment of the nephron has a speciﬁc function. e proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is the site of bulk reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, soluble vitamins, salt, and water. It is also the site of secretion for hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonia, and urea. e descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but not salt; therefore, as the ﬁltrate moves into the more osmotically concentrated renal medulla, water is reabsorbed from the ﬁltrate. e vasa recta and nephron ﬂow in opposite directions, creating a countercurrent multiplier system that allows maximal reabsorption e ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to salt but not water; therefore, salt is reabsorbed both passively and actively. e diluting segment is in the outer medulla; because salt is actively reabsorbed in this site, the ﬁltrate actually becomes hypotonic compared to the blood. e distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is responsive to aldosterone and is a site of salt reabsorption and waste product excretion, like the e collecting duct is responsive to both aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone and has variable permeability, which allows reabsorption of the right amount of water depending on the body’s e kidney is under hormonal control. When blood pressure (and volume) are low, two diﬀerent hormonal systems are activated. Aldosterone is a steroid hormone regulated by the renin– angiotensin–aldosterone system that increases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, thereby increasing water reabsorption. is results in an increased blood volume (and pressure), but no change in blood osmolarity. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) is a peptide hormone synthesized by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Its release is stimulated not only by low blood volume but also by high blood osmolarity.
*$%pass: It increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, increasing water reabsorption. is results in an increased blood volume (and pressure) and a decreased blood e kidney can regulate pH by selective reabsorption or secretion of bicarbonate or hydrogen ions. e skin acts as a barrier, protecting us from the elements and invasion e skin is composed of three major layers: the hypodermis (subcutaneous layer), dermis, and epidermis. e epidermis is composed of ﬁve layers: the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum. e stratum basale contains stem cells that proliferate to form keratinocytes. Keratinocyte nuclei are lost in the stratum granulosum, and many thin layers form in the stratum Melanocytes produce melanin, which protects the skin from DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation; melanin is passed to Langerhans cells are special macrophages that serve as antigen- presenting cells in the skin. e dermis is composed of two layers: the papillary layer and the Many sensory cells are located in the dermis, including Merkel cells (deep pressure and texture), free nerve endings (pain), Meissner’s corpuscles (light touch), Ruﬃni endings (stretch), and Pacinian corpuscles (deep pressure and vibration). e hypodermis contains fat and connective tissue and connects the skin to the rest of the body. e skin is important for thermoregulation, or the maintenance of a constant internal temperature. Cooling mechanisms include sweating, which draws heat from the body through evaporation of water from sweat, and vasodilation. Sweat glands are innervated by postganglionic cholinergic Warming mechanisms include: piloerection, in which arrector pili muscles contract, causing hairs to stand on end (trapping a layer of warmed air around the skin); vasoconstriction; shivering; and insulation provided by fat. e skin also prevents dehydration and salt loss from the body.

Bowman’s capsule is the site of ﬁltration, through which water, ions, amino acids, vitamins, and glucose pass (essentially everything besides cells and proteins). e proximal convoluted tubule controls solute identity, reabsorbing vitamins, amino acids, and glucose, while secreting potassium and hydrogen ions, ammonia, and urea. e descending limb of the loop of Henle is important for water reabsorption, and uses the medullary concentration gradient. e ascending limb of the loop of Henle is important for salt reabsorption and dilution of the urine in the diluting segment. e distal convoluted tubule, like the PCT, is important for solute identity by reabsorbing salts while secreting potassium and hydrogen ions, ammonia, and urea. e collecting duct is important for urine concentration; its variable permeability allows water to be reabsorbed based on the needs of the body. 1.

Science Mastery Assessment Explanations e glomerulus functions like a sieve; small molecules dissolved in the ﬂuid will pass through the glomerulus, including glucose, which is later reabsorbed.
*$%pass: Large molecules, such as proteins, and cells, such as erythrocytes and platelets, will not be able to pass through the glomerular Sodium is actively transported out of the nephron in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, where the concentration of sodium outside of the nephron is higher than inside; thus, energy is required to transport the sodium molecules against their concentration gradient, eliminating (A) and (C). In the inner medulla, however, sodium and other ions (such as chloride) diﬀuse passively down their concentration gradients at the thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle, making (B) the correct answer. e thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is thick because its cells contain many mitochondria—which produce the ATP needed for active transport of sodium and chloride out of the ﬁltrate, eliminating (D). e region of the kidney that has the lowest solute concentration is the cortex, where the proximal convoluted tubule and a part of the distal convoluted tubule are found. e solute concentration increases as one descends into the medulla, and concentrated urine can be found in the renal pelvis. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which divides into many aﬀerent arterioles that run through the medulla and into the cortex. Each aﬀerent arteriole branches into a convoluted network of capillaries called a glomerulus. Rather than converging directly into a vein, the capillaries converge into an eﬀerent arteriole, which divides into a ﬁne capillary network known as the vasa recta. e vasa recta capillaries envelop the nephron tubule, where they reabsorb various ions, and then converge into the renal vein. e arrangement of tandem capillary beds is known as a portal system. All of the answer choices describe ADH or aldosterone.
*$%pass: ese two hormones ultimately act to increase water reabsorption in the kidney; their respective mechanisms of action, however, are diﬀerent. ADH increases water reabsorption by increasing the permeability of the collecting duct to water, whereas aldosterone stimulates reabsorption of sodium from the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Using this knowledge, we can now evaluate the answer choices. (C) is the correct answer because ADH does not act on the proximal convoluted tubule, but rather on the collecting duct. Essential substances, such as glucose, salts, amino acids, and water, are reabsorbed from the ﬁltrate and returned to the blood in the vasa recta. In general, reabsorption refers to the movement of solutes from the ﬁltrate back into the blood. e hypothalamus functions as a thermostat that regulates body temperature. When it’s cold outside, nervous stimulation to the blood vessels in the skin is increased, causing the vessels to constrict. is constriction diminishes blood ﬂow to the skin surface and prevents heat loss. Sweat glands are turned oﬀ to prevent heat loss through evaporation. Skeletal muscles are stimulated to shiver (rapidly contract), which increases the metabolic rate and produces heat. e hypothalamus is also involved in other processes, including the release of endocrine hormones, regulation of appetite, and circadian rhythms. e ﬁltrate enters Bowman’s capsule and then ﬂows into the proximal convoluted tubule, where virtually all glucose, amino acids, and other important organic molecules are reabsorbed via e kidneys function to eliminate wastes such as urea, while reabsorbing various important substances such as glucose and amino acids for reuse by the body. Generation of a solute concentration gradient from the cortex to the medulla allows a considerable amount of water to be reabsorbed. Excretion of concentrated urine serves to limit water losses from the body and helps to preserve blood volume.
*$%pass: us, the primary function of the nephron is to create urine that is hypertonic to the blood, making (A) the correct answer and eliminating (B) and (D). Water should be reabsorbed from the ﬁltrate, so urine should be hypertonic to the ﬁltrate, e glomerulus is the most likely location of pathology if large proteins are detected in the urine. is is because large proteins should not be able to pass through the ﬁlter of the glomerulus in the ﬁrst place. Once large proteins are in the ﬁltrate, no other nephron structure can reabsorb them. us, the only likely source of protein in the urine is glomerular pathology. e layer of the skin that is predominantly loose connective tissue is the papillary layer of the dermis. e stratum corneum and stratum lucidum, (A) and (B), contain dead keratinocytes, while the reticular layer, (D), consists of dense connective tissue. When the pH of the blood is high, this indicates that the blood is alkalemic. In order to correct the pH of the blood, the kidney will increase the excretion of a base, namely bicarbonate. Excretion of urea would have little eﬀect on the pH, eliminating (A). While ammonia is a base, it is quite toxic and is generally converted into urea before excretion, eliminating (B). Excretion of hydrogen ions would exacerbate the alkalemia, eliminating (C). e stratum basale contains the stem cells that proliferate to form keratinocytes, which then ascend through the other layers of skin until they are shed from the stratum corneum. Normally, angiotensin II causes secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone serves to increase reabsorption of sodium, while promoting excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. us, blocking the release of aldosterone should result in decreased reabsorption of sodium, while decreasing excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions.
*$%pass: is eliminates (A) and (D) and makes (B) the correct answer. In the absence of aldosterone, less sodium reabsorption will occur, leading to less water reabsorption, eliminating (C). An excess of acetylcholine will lead to activation of all parasympathetic neurons, preganglionic sympathetic neurons, and the postganglionic sympathetic neurons that innervate sweat glands. Because the parasympathetic nervous system causes contraction of the bladder, one would expect increased urination. e increased activation of sweat glands would lead to increased sweating as well.

This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 3B: Structure and integrative functions of the main organ systems Large disasters or traumatic events like wars or earthquakes can deeply aﬀect the health of populations, which also has an impact on the practice of medicine, sometimes leading to the discovery of new medical conditions. During World War II, Nazi Germany bombed London for 57 consecutive days during the beginning of what came to be known as the Blitzkrieg, or an eight-month “lightning war.” Victims of the Blitz, as it is known in London, included those aﬄicted with a speciﬁc set of symptoms: pain and swelling with accompanying eﬀects of depleted blood volume (shock, weakness, low blood pressure, and decreased urine output). Less obvious was acute kidney failure, which could lead quickly to death if le untreated. What caused the Blitz victims to suﬀer from these symptoms? Extreme physical trauma to muscles—namely, compression—destroys skeletal muscle tissue. is condition is called rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo– refers to striation, myo– to muscle, and –lysis to breakdown). e products of skeletal muscle destruction, some of which are toxic, circulate in the blood until they are ﬁltered out.
*$%pass: Creatine kinase is one of these products; in fact, rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed with a creatine kinase level ﬁve times the normal upper limit. Myoglobin is another. Much like hemoglobin, myoglobin uses heme to carry oxygen; it is not, however, housed within a red blood cell. us, an erythrocyte-free urine sample that tests positive for heme points compellingly toward rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin oxygen reserves are just one of the specialized features of muscles, as we will see in this chapter. Skeletal muscles are only able to exert an eﬀect on the body by moving bony structures around joints. Further, skeletal muscle isn’t the only form of muscle in the body; smooth muscle plays roles in the cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive, and digestive systems, and cardiac muscle comprises the contractile tissue of the heart. Bones are more than simply a support structure, however; they also provide protection to internal organs, serve as a storage reserve of calcium and other minerals, and are the site of hematopoiesis. In this chapter, we’ll explore the biology of all of these tissues, completing our tour of systems anatomy and physiology. The Muscular System After Chapter 11.1, you will be able to: Categorize muscles as skeletal, smooth, or cardiac based on their innervation Order the series of events in muscular contraction Explain the relationship between ATP binding and muscular contraction Recall the meaning of the terms summation, simple twitch, and tetanus Identify the zones and bands within a sarcomere and predict their length changes e muscular system is composed of not only skeletal muscle, but also smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle is essential for supporting the body and facilitating movement.
*$%pass: e contraction of skeletal muscle also compresses venous structures and helps propel blood through the low-pressure venous system toward the heart, as well as lymph through the lymphatic system. Rapid muscle contraction also leads to shivering, which is important in thermoregulation. Smooth muscle is responsible for involuntary movement, such as the rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle in the digestive system called peristalsis. Smooth muscle also aids in the regulation of blood pressure by constricting and relaxing the vasculature. Cardiac muscle is a special type of muscle that is able to maintain rhythmic contraction of the heart without nervous system input. In this section, we will discuss each type of muscle as well as the physiology of muscles. Types of Muscle Muscle can be divided into the three diﬀerent subtypes: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Each muscle type performs speciﬁc functions, although they share some similarities. All muscle is capable of contraction, which relies on calcium ions. All muscle is innervated, although —as we will see—the part of the nervous system that innervates the muscle and the ability of the muscle to contract without nervous input varies from type to type. Skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movement and is therefore innervated by the somatic nervous system. Due to the arrangement of actin and myosin into repeating units called sarcomeres, it appears striped or striated when viewed microscopically. Skeletal muscle is multinucleated because it is formed as individual muscle cells fuse into long rods during Poultry provides a great example of the difference between red and white fibers. Most muscles of support, such as the thigh, are considered dark meat and contain a high concentration of red fibers.
*$%pass: The pectoral muscles (breast meat), used by some poultry for only short bursts of flight, are considered white meat and have a high concentration of white ere are multiple diﬀerent types of ﬁbers within skeletal muscle. Red ﬁbers, also known as slow-twitch ﬁbers, have high myoglobin content and primarily derive their energy aerobically. Myoglobin is an oxygen carrier that uses iron in a heme group to bind oxygen, imparting a red color. Red ﬁbers also contain many mitochondria to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. White ﬁbers, also known as fast-twitch ﬁbers, contain much less myoglobin. Because there is less myoglobin, and therefore less iron, the color is lighter. ese two types of ﬁbers can be mixed in muscles. Muscles that contract slowly, but that can sustain activity (such as the muscles that support posture), contain a predominance of red ﬁbers. Muscles that contract rapidly, but fatigue quickly, contain mostly white Smooth muscle is responsible for involuntary action. us, smooth muscle is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is found in the respiratory tree, digestive tract, bladder, uterus, blood vessel walls, and many other locations. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus located in the center of the cell. Just like skeletal muscle, smooth muscle cells contain actin and myosin, but the ﬁbers are not as well organized, so striations cannot be seen. Compared to skeletal muscle, smooth muscle is capable of more sustained contractions; a constant state of low-level contraction, as may be seen in the blood vessels, is called tonus. Smooth muscle can actually contract without nervous system input in what is known as myogenic activity. In this case, the muscle cells contract directly in response to stretch or other stimuli. The MCAT loves to test the fact that both smooth and cardiac muscle exhibit myogenic activity.
*$%pass: These muscle cells will respond to nervous input, but do not require external signals to undergo contraction. Cardiac muscle has characteristics of both smooth and skeletal muscle types. Cardiac muscle is primarily uninucleated, but cells may contain two nuclei. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle contraction is involuntary and innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Unlike smooth muscle, cardiac muscle appears striated like skeletal. One of the unique characteristics of cardiac muscle is how each cardiac myocyte communicates. Cardiac muscle cells are connected by intercalated discs, which contain many gap junctions. ese gap junctions are connections between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, allowing for the ﬂow of ions directly between cells. is allows for rapid and coordinated depolarization of muscle cells and eﬃcient contraction of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle cells are able to deﬁne and maintain their own rhythm, termed myogenic activity. Starting at the sinoatrial (SA) node, depolarization spreads using conduction pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. From there, the depolarization spreads to the bundle of His and its branches, and then to the Purkinje ﬁbers. e gap junctions allow for progressive depolarizations to spread via ion ﬂow across the gap junctions between cells. e nervous and endocrine systems also play a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. e vagus nerve provides parasympathetic outﬂow to the heart and slows the heart rate. Norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons or epinephrine from the adrenal medulla binds to adrenergic receptors in the heart, causing an increased heart rate and greater contractility. One of the ways epinephrine does this is by increasing intracellular calcium levels within cardiac myocytes. Ultimately, cardiac contraction—like that of all types of muscle—relies on e main characteristics of each muscle type are summarized in Table 11.1.
*$%pass: Many nuclei per cell 1–2 nuclei per cell 1 nucleus per cell Ca2+ required for Ca2+ required for Ca2+ required for Table 11.1 Types of Muscle Microscopic Structure of Skeletal Muscle Each type of muscle has a speciﬁc microscopic structure. However, the MCAT tends to focus on the contractile elements and microscopic structure of skeletal muscle. In order to accurately answer those questions on Test Day, let’s take a moment to discuss skeletal muscle in detail. e sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of skeletal muscle. Sarcomeres are made of thick and thin ﬁlaments. e thick ﬁlaments are organized bundles of myosin, whereas the thin ﬁlaments are made of actin along with two other proteins: troponin and tropomyosin. ese proteins help to regulate the interaction between the actin and myosin ﬁlaments. Another protein, titin, acts as a spring and anchors the actin and myosin ﬁlaments together, preventing excessive stretching of the muscle. To remember which filament is associated with troponin and tropomyosin, remember that actin has a T in it. Each sarcomere is divided into diﬀerent lines, zones, and bands, as shown in Figure 11.1. Z-lines deﬁne the boundaries of each sarcomere. e M-line runs down the center of the sarcomere, through the middle of the myosin ﬁlaments. e I-band is the region containing exclusively thin ﬁlaments, whereas the H-zone contains only thick ﬁlaments. e A-band contains the thick ﬁlaments in their entirety, including any overlap with thin ﬁlaments. During contraction, the H-zone, I-band, the distance between Z-lines, and the distance between M-lines all become smaller, whereas the A-band’s size Figure 11.1 The Sarcomere Sarcomeres are the functional units of striated muscle. To remember which is the thin and thick filament, remember acthin: actin filaments are thin (while myosin filaments are thick).
*$%pass: Gross Structure of Myocytes Sarcomeres are attached end-to-end to form myoﬁbrils. Myoﬁbrils are surrounded by a covering known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a modiﬁed endoplasmic reticulum that contains a high concentration of Ca2+ ions. e sarcoplasm is a modiﬁed cytoplasm located just outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum. e cell membrane of a myocyte is known as the sarcolemma. e sarcolemma is capable of propagating an action potential and can distribute the action potential to all sarcomeres in a muscle using a system of transverse tubules (T-tubules) that are oriented perpendicularly to the myoﬁbrils, as shown in Figure 11.2. Each myocyte, or muscle cell, contains many myoﬁbrils arranged in parallel and can also be called a muscle ﬁber. e nuclei, of which there are many, are usually found at the periphery of the cell. Finally, many myocytes in parallel form a muscle. Figure 11.2 Architecture of Skeletal Muscle A muscle is composed of parallel myocytes (muscle fibers), which are composed of parallel myofibrils. Parts of the sarcomere: Z—Z is the end of the alphabet, and the end of the sarcomere M—Middle of the myosin filaments I—I is a thin letter (thin filaments only) H—H is a thick letter (thick filaments only) A—All of the thick filament, whether or not it is overlapping The sarcoplasmic reticulum is just a fancy name for the specialized endoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. A myofibril is an arrangement of many sarcomeres in series. A muscle fiber (or myocyte, or muscle cell) contains many myofibrils within it, arranged in parallel. A muscle is made up of parallel muscle fibers. These names are very similar; pay careful attention to terminology when reading about muscle structure! Contraction of muscle requires a series of coordinated steps that are repeated to induce further shortening.
*$%pass: is process depends on both ATP Contraction starts at the neuromuscular junction, where the nervous system communicates with muscles via motor (eﬀerent) neurons. is signal travels down the neuron until it reaches the nerve terminal (synaptic bouton), where acetylcholine is released into the synapse. In the case of the neuromuscular junction, the nerve terminal can also be called the motor end plate. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the sarcolemma, causing depolarization. Each nerve terminal controls a group of myocytes; together, the nerve terminal and its myocytes constitute a motor unit. Depolarization triggers an action potential, which spreads down the sarcolemma to the T-tubules. e action potential travels down the T- tubules into the muscle tissues to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When the action potential reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+ is ultimately released. e calcium ions bind to a regulatory subunit in troponin, triggering a change in the conﬁrmation of tropomyosin, to which troponin is bound. is change exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin thin ﬁlament, as shown in Figure 11.3. Figure 11.3 Regulation of Contraction with Calcium Calcium binds to troponin, leading to a conformational change in tropomyosin, which exposes the myosin-binding sites of actin. Shortening of the Sarcomere e free globular heads of the myosin molecules move toward and bind with the exposed sites on actin. e newly formed actin–myosin cross bridges then allow myosin to pull on actin, which draws the thin ﬁlaments toward the M-line, resulting in shortening of the sarcomere. e actin–myosin cross-bridge cycle is illustrated in Figure 11.4. Figure 11.4 The Actin–Myosin Cross-Bridge Cycle Calcium and ATP are essential for muscle contraction and Starting at the top of the diagram, myosin carrying hydrolyzed ATP (ADP and an inorganic phosphate, Pi) is able to bind with the myosin-binding site.
*$%pass: e release of the inorganic phosphate and ADP in rapid succession provides the energy for the powerstroke and results in sliding of the actin ﬁlament over the myosin ﬁlament. en, ATP binds to the myosin head, releasing it from actin. is ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, which recocks the myosin head so that it is in position to initiate another cross- bridge cycle. e repetitive binding and releasing of myosin heads on actin ﬁlaments allows the thin ﬁlament to slide along the thick ﬁlament, causing sequential shortening of the sarcomere. is is known as the sliding ﬁlament model, as shown in Figure 11.5. Figure 11.5 Sarcomere Contraction When a sarcomere contracts, both the H-zone and I-band shorten, while the A- band is unchanged. It is the dissociation of ADP and Pi from myosin that is responsible for the powerstroke, not the hydrolysis of ATP. The binding of ATP is required for releasing the myosin head from the Acetylcholine is degraded in the synapse by the enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase. is results in termination of the signal at the neuromuscular junction and allows the sarcolemma to repolarize. As the signal decays, calcium release ceases, and the SR takes up calcium from the sarcoplasm. e SR tightly controls intracellular calcium concentrations so that muscles are contracted only when necessary. ATP binds to the myosin heads, freeing them from actin. Once the myosin and actin disconnect, the sarcomere can return to its original width. Without calcium, the myosin- binding sites are covered by tropomyosin and contraction is prevented. After death, ATP production ceases. Myosin heads cannot detach from actin, making it impossible for muscles to relax and lengthen. This condition is known as rigor mortis.
*$%pass: Stimulation, Summation, and Muscle Fatigue Muscle cells, like neurons, exhibit an all-or-nothing response; either they respond completely to a stimulus or not at all. For muscle cells to respond, stimuli must reach a threshold value. e strength of a response from one muscle cell cannot be changed because the only options are all or nothing. erefore, nerves control overall force by the number of motor units they recruit to respond. Maximal response occurs when all ﬁbers within a muscle are stimulated to contract simultaneously. Why do muscle fibers contract in an all-or-nothing fashion? Because they are innervated by neurons that deliver signals using action potentials, which are all-or-nothing phenomena as well. Action potentials are discussed in Chapter 4 of MCAT Biology Review. A simple twitch is the response of a single muscle ﬁber to a brief stimulus at or above threshold, as shown in Figure 11.6a. It consists of a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. e latent period is the time between reaching threshold and the onset of contraction. It is during this time that the action potential spreads along the muscle and allows for calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. e muscle then contracts, and, assuming calcium is cleared from the sarcoplasm, it then Figure 11.6 Force of Muscle Contraction Due to a Simple Twitch and Tetanus (a) A simple twitch contraction; (b) Summation of frequent simple twitches can lead to tetanus. Summation and Tetanus If a muscle ﬁber is exposed to frequent and prolonged stimulation, it will have insuﬃcient time to relax. e contractions will combine, become stronger and more prolonged. is is known as frequency summation, as shown in Figure 11.6b. If the contractions become so frequent that the muscle is unable to relax at all, this is known as tetanus.
*$%pass: Prolonged tetanus will result in muscle fatigue, explained below. Note that tetanus (the disease) includes tetanus (the physiological phenomenon) as one of its primary clinical features, but that tetanic physiology also occurs under normal circumstances with multiple simple twitches in succession. The disease tetanus is caused by a bacterium called Clostridium tetani that releases the toxin tetanospasmin. Tetanospasmin blocks the release of GABA from the neurons that inhibit motor neurons, making the motor neurons overexcitable. This leads to constant contraction of muscles, which can be so strong as to fracture bones. Tetanus can usually be prevented after exposure by administration of a tetanus immunoglobulin. Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking Previous research has shown muscle tension generation is influenced by DV: muscle tension generation temperature of the muscle fibers. To further establish the connection between how temperature interacts with muscle tension generation, researchers measured the rate of tension rise at various temperatures. More specifically, researchers established change in the rate of tension rise is different at high temperatures (25°C to 35°C) and low temperatures (20°C to 10°C). Experiment is trying to test the connection between temperature Figure 1 Tension generation rate versus Trend: Tension generation rate is lower and the slope of the line is more steep at lower temperatures Another study is conducted that investigates the relationship between tetanic tension responses and temperature of the same type of muscle fibers.
*$%pass: In this experiment, researchers directly observe the tension generation of the muscle plotted over time with There are two studies in the passage, the MCAT will likely ask for comparisons between the two IV: temperature again DV: tetanic tension responses (tetanic must be another type of Trend: as temperature decreases, the curve flattens out (i.e., change in tension remains low) Figure 2 Tetanic tension responses obtained from one intact fiber bundle at four different temperatures, using suitable stimulation frequencies and duration. Adapted from Ranatunga K. W. (2018). Temperature eﬀects on force and actinmyosin interaction in muscle: a look back on some experimental ﬁndings. International Does Study 2’s data conflict with Study 1’s data? is question asks us whether two sets of data conﬂict with one another. To analyze this relationship, we need to draw the proper conclusions from each data set, and see how these two data sets are related. Conﬂict is when one data set reveals a relationship that is either not validated by similar data sets, or directly contradicted by similar data sets. To start, we’ll want to make sure we can understand each data set separately. e ﬁrst study seeks to investigate how temperature aﬀects the rate of tension generation by the muscle tissues. e results of this experiment are displayed as a line graph. One of the ﬁrst things to look at when analyzing any ﬁgure are axes labels and their corresponding units. On the y-axis, we see the rate of tension rise. So, a higher value on that axis means the muscle can generate tension faster, or in other words, have a higher rate. For the x-axis, things are a bit more confusing. e axis displays temperature, but in two ways.
*$%pass: Technically, it is the reciprocal of temperature, but fortunately for us the graph is also labeled with the corresponding real temperature location. Because of the reciprocal, higher temperatures are found closer to the le, and temperature decreases going toward the right. Besides this complication, the graph shows a pretty straightforward relationship. At higher temperatures (close to physiological temperature), the rate of tension rise is high, with the drop in rate from 35°C to 25°C being relatively minor. At lower temperatures, the rate of tension rise is much lower, and the change in rate as temperature decreases is more dramatic. Study 2 examined a similar relationship between temperature and muscle tension. Here the graph shows a more visual representation of how the tension is generated in those muscles. From the shape of the curve, it appears that the measurement is for one stimulation, as the tension rises once and quickly tapers oﬀ. From the graph, we can make some quick observations. At higher temperatures, the max tension generated is higher, as well as the time required to reach peak tension. When temperature is lowered, muscle tension generation drops signiﬁcantly. To evaluate whether Study 2’s data conﬂicts with Study 1’s data, we need to compare and assess how the two data sets are related. Both of these graphs have temperature as the independent variable, so we must look at what each data set demonstrates with that change in temperature. Study 1 shows a rise in rate of tension. While Study 2 does not report rate of tension rise explicitly, it does show tension over time, which is essentially rate! At 35°C and 25°C, the slope of tension increase is sharp, meaning that the rate of tension increase is high.
*$%pass: At lower temperature, the slope is more gentle, and tension generation takes signiﬁcantly longer. is means that Study 2 corroborates Study 1’s data in that higher temperature is correlated with a higher rate, while lower temperature is correlated with lower What about the change in rate? How is that visualized? Study 1 shows that change in the rate of tension rise at high temperature is more mild than the change in rate at lower temperatures. From Study 2’s graph, we can see that from 35°C to 25°C, the change in the slope (and therefore rate) of the tension is rather small. However, the change in slope between 15°C and 5°C is much more dramatic. Since we know that the slope represents the rate of tension rise, the change in slope must represent the change in rate. us, Study 2 does not conﬂict with Study 1. In fact, the two studies corroborate each other! Oxygen Debt and Muscle Fatigue Muscles require ATP to function. Slow-twitch (red) muscle ﬁbers have high levels of mitochondria and thus use oxidative phosphorylation to make ATP. However, this means that high concentrations of oxygen are required to generate the large amounts of ATP muscle cells need. ere are two supplemental energy reserves in muscle. Creatine phosphate is created by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to creatine during times of rest. is reaction can then be reversed during muscle use to quickly generate ATP from ADP: creatine + ATP creatine phosphate + ADP Muscle also contains myoglobin, which binds oxygen with high aﬃnity. As exercising muscles run out of oxygen, they use myoglobin reserves to keep aerobic metabolism going. Fast-twitch (white) muscle ﬁbers have fewer mitochondria and must rely on glycolysis and fermentation to make ATP under most circumstances.
*$%pass: When a person exercises, heart rate and respiratory rate increase in order to move more oxygen to actively respiring muscles. e oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve undergoes a right shi in the presence of increased carbon dioxide concentration, increased hydrogen ion concentration (decreased pH), and increased temperature. However, even with these adaptations, muscle use can quickly overwhelm the ability of the body to deliver oxygen. en, even red muscle ﬁbers must switch to anaerobic metabolism and produce lactic acid, at which point the muscle begins to fatigue. e diﬀerence between the amount of oxygen needed by the muscles and the actual amount present is called the oxygen debt. Aer the cessation of strenuous exercise, the body must metabolize all of the lactic acid it has produced. Most lactic acid is converted back into pyruvate, which can enter the citric acid cycle. is process requires oxygen, and the amount of oxygen required to recover from strenuous exercise is equal to the oxygen MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 11.1 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1.

Start with neurotransmitter release and trace the pathway to the point where myosin binds 4. What role does the binding of ATP to the myosin head play in the cross-bridge cycle?
*$%pass: What about the dissociation of ADP and inorganic phosphate from the Binding of ATP: Dissociation of ADP and inorganic phosphate: 5. What is tetanus (the physiological phenomenon, not the disease)? The Skeletal System After Chapter 11.2, you will be able to: Distinguish between compact and spongy bone Identify the three structural parts of a bone and their relative contributions to Recall the major chemical component of bone Describe the function(s) of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes Name the substance that lubricates movable joints and where it is produced ere are two types of skeletons: exoskeletons and endoskeletons. Exoskeletons encase whole organisms and are usually found in arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects. Vertebrates, including humans, have endoskeletons. Endoskeletons are internal, but are not able to protect the so tissue structures as well as exoskeletons. However, exoskeletons must be shed and regrown to accommodate growth. Endoskeletons are much better able to accommodate the growth of a larger organism. e components of our skeletal system are divided into axial and appendicular skeletons. e axial skeleton consists of the skull, vertebral column, rib cage, and hyoid bone (a small bone in the anterior neck used for swallowing); it provides the basic central framework for the body. e appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs (humerus, radius and ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges in the upper limb; and femur, tibia and ﬁbula, tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges in the lower limb); the pectoral girdle (scapula and clavicle); and pelvis. Both skeleton types are covered by other structures (muscle, connective tissue, and vasculature). e structure of the skeleton is shown in Figure 11.7, with many of the bones labeled (individual bones are labeled in red). Figure 11.7 Anatomy of the Human Skeleton An adult human has 206 bones.
*$%pass: Over 100 of these are in the hands and feet. e skeleton is created from two major components: bone and cartilage. Bone is a connective tissue derived from embryonic mesoderm. Bone is much harder than cartilage, but is relatively lightweight. Macroscopic Bone Structure e structure of bone can be seen in Figure 11.8. Figure 11.8 Anatomy of a Long Bone (Humerus) Bone’s characteristic strength comes speciﬁcally from compact bone. It lives up to its name, as it is both dense and strong. e other type of bone structure is spongy or cancellous bone. e lattice structure of spongy bone is visible under microscopy and consists of bony spicules (points) known as trabeculae. e cavities between trabeculae are ﬁlled with bone marrow, which may be either red or yellow. Red marrow is ﬁlled with hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for the generation of all the cells in our blood; yellow marrow is composed primarily of fat and is relatively inactive. Bones in the appendicular skeleton are typically long bones, which are characterized by cylindrical shas called diaphyses that swell at each end to form metaphyses, and that terminate in epiphyses. e outermost portions of bone are composed of compact bone, whereas the internal core is made of spongy bone. Long bone diaphyses and metaphyses are full of bone marrow. e epiphyses, on the other hand, use their spongy cores for more eﬀective dispersion of force and pressure at the joints. At the internal edge of the epiphysis is an epiphyseal (growth) plate, which is a cartilaginous structure and the site of longitudinal growth. Prior to adulthood, the epiphyseal plate is ﬁlled with mitotic cells that contribute to growth; during puberty, these epiphyseal plates close and vertical growth is halted.
*$%pass: Finally, a ﬁbrous sheath called the periosteum surrounds the long bone to protect it as well as serve as a site for muscle attachment. Some periosteal cells are capable of diﬀerentiating into bone-forming cells; a healthy periosteum is necessary for bone growth and repair. The root lig–comes from Latin, where it means to “to tie; bind.” Think of DNA ligase, discussed in Chapter 6 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. Think of ligands in complex ions, discussed in Chapter 9 of MCAT General Chemistry Review. In this case, ligaments tie bones to each other to stabilize joints. Structures in the musculoskeletal system are held together with dense connective tissue. Tendons attach muscle to bone and ligaments hold bones together at joints. Microscopic Bone Structure e strength of compact bone comes from the bone matrix, which has both organic and inorganic components. e organic components include collagen, glycoproteins, and other peptides. e inorganic components include calcium, phosphate, and hydroxide ions, which harden together to form hydroxyapatite crystals (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2). Minerals such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium are also stored in bone. Strong bones require uniform distribution of organic and inorganic materials. e bony matrix is ordered into structural units known as osteons or Haversian systems, as shown in Figure 11.9. Each of these osteons contains concentric circles of bony matrix called lamellae surrounding a central microscopic channel. Longitudinal channels (those with an axis parallel to the bone) are known as Haversian canals, while transverse channels (those with an axis perpendicular to the bone) are known as Volkmann’s canals. ese canals contain the blood vessels, nerve ﬁbers, and lymph vessels that maintain the health of the bone. Between the lamellar rings are small spaces called lacunae, which house mature bone cells known as osteocytes.
*$%pass: e lacunae are interconnected by tiny channels called canaliculi that allow for the exchange of nutrients and wastes between osteocytes and the Haversian and Volkmann’s canals. Figure 11.9 Bone Matrix Cross-sectional and longitudinal views highlighting Haversian systems Bone appears to be rigid and static, but it is actually quite dynamic. It is both vascular and innervated, which is why it hurts so much to break a bone. In addition, bone remains in a vigorous equilibrium between construction and destruction, known as bone remodeling. Two cell types are largely responsible for building and maintaining strong bones: osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts build bone, whereas osteoclasts, polynucleated resident macrophages of bone, resorb it. ese processes together contribute to the constant turnover of bone, as shown in Figure 11.10. During bone formation, essential ingredients such as calcium and phosphate are obtained from the blood. During bone resorption, these ions are released back into the bloodstream. Bone remodeling occurs in response to stress, and bone actually remodels in such a way as to accommodate the repetitive stresses faced by the body. Endocrine hormones may also aﬀect bone metabolism. Parathyroid hormone, a peptide hormone released by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood calcium, promotes resorption of bone, increasing the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the blood. Vitamin D, which is activated by parathyroid hormone, also promotes the resorption of bone. is may seem counterintuitive at ﬁrst—isn’t vitamin D used to promote bone growth? Indeed, the resorption of bone in response to vitamin D actually encourages the growth of new, stronger bone, thus overcompensating for the eﬀect of resorbing bone in the ﬁrst place. Finally, calcitonin, a peptide hormone released by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid in response to high blood calcium, promotes bone formation, lowering blood calcium levels.
*$%pass: Figure 11.10 Bone Remodeling Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease in the United States. It is thought to be the result of increased osteoclast resorption and some concomitant slowing of bone formation, both of which lead to loss of bone mass. Estrogen is believed to help prevent osteoporosis by stimulating osteoblast activity. Osteoblasts build bone. Osteoclasts chew bone. Cartilage is soer and more ﬂexible than bone. Cartilage consists of a ﬁrm but elastic matrix called chondrin that is secreted by cells called chondrocytes. Fetal skeletons are mostly made up of cartilage. is is advantageous because fetuses must grow and develop in a conﬁned environment and then must traverse the birth canal. Adults have cartilage only in body parts that need a little extra ﬂexibility or cushioning (external ear, nose, walls of the larynx and trachea, intervertebral discs, and joints). Cartilage also diﬀers from bone in that it is avascular (without blood and lymphatic vessels) and is not innervated. Most of the bones of the body are created by the hardening of cartilage into bone. is process is known as endochondral ossiﬁcation and is responsible for the formation of most of the long bones of the body. Bones may also be formed through intramembranous ossiﬁcation, in which undiﬀerentiated embryonic connective tissue (mesenchymal tissue) is transformed into, and replaced by, bone. is occurs in bones of the skull. Joints and Movement Like bone and cartilage, joints are also made of connective tissue and come in two major varieties: immovable and movable. Immovable joints consist of bones that are fused together to form sutures or similar ﬁbrous joints.
*$%pass: ese joints are found primarily in the head, where they anchor bones of the Movable joints, structures of which are shown in Figure 11.11, include hinge joints (like the elbow or knee), ball-and-socket joints (like the shoulder or hip), and others. ey permit bones to shi relative to one another. Movable joints are strengthened by ligaments, which are pieces of ﬁbrous tissue that connect bones to one another, and consist of a synovial capsule, which encloses the actual joint cavity (articular cavity). A layer of so tissue called the synovium secretes synovial ﬂuid, which lubricates the movement of structures in the joint space. e articular cartilage contributes to the joint by coating the articular surfaces of the bones so that impact is restricted to the lubricated joint cartilage, rather than to the bones. Figure 11.11 Structures in a Movable Joint Degradation of articular cartilage (cartilage in joints) can lead to medical issues like osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis (or “arthritis” in the lay population) is painful because a lack of cartilage in joints leads to bones rubbing directly on one another. When a muscle is attached to two bones, its contraction will cause one of the bones to move. e end of the muscle with a larger attachment to bone (usually the proximal connection) is called the origin. e end with the smaller attachment to bone (usually the distal connection) is called the insertion. Oen, our muscles work in antagonistic pairs; one relaxes while the other contracts. Such is the case in the arm, where the biceps brachii and triceps brachii work antagonistically, as shown in Figure 11.12. When the biceps contracts and the triceps relaxes, the elbow is ﬂexed; when the triceps contracts and the biceps relaxes, the elbow is extended. Muscles can also be synergistic—working together to accomplish the same function.
*$%pass: Figure 11.12 Antagonistic Muscle Pairs The biceps brachii and triceps brachii are an example of a muscle pair that works antagonistically; the contraction of one causes the other to elongate. Muscles may also be classiﬁed by the types of movements they coordinate. A ﬂexor muscle decreases the angle across a joint (like the biceps brachii); an extensor increases or straightens this angle (like the triceps brachii). An abductor moves a part of the body away from the midline (like the deltoid); an adductor moves a part of the body toward the midline (like the pectoralis major). Medial and lateral rotation describe motions that occur in limbs; a medial rotator rotates the axis of the limb toward the midline (like the subscapularis), whereas a lateral rotator rotates the axis of the limb away from the midline (like the infraspinatus). MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 11.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What is the difference between compact and spongy bone? 2. What are the three structural parts of a bone? Which part contributes most to 3. What chemical forms most of the inorganic component of bone? 4. What are the functions of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes? 5. What liquid provides the lubrication for movable joints? What tissue produces it? One concept that has been emphasized throughout the past eight chapters on anatomy and physiology is the notion that organ systems work together in order to achieve a desired eﬀect. e musculoskeletal system is no diﬀerent. Usually, we think of the musculoskeletal system as being responsible for movement, but to limit the musculoskeletal system to that function would be shortsighted. e bones are reservoirs of calcium and other minerals that can be released through hormonal signaling. ey protect the internal organs and provide support for the body.
*$%pass: Muscle tissue not only moves these bones, but pumps blood through the body and is key to the function of a number of other systems, including respiration, digestion, blood pressure and vascular tone, and reproduction and childbirth. As you review anatomy and physiology and master the fundamentals of each organ system, be sure to pay special attention to how each organ system interacts with the others. While the MCAT expects you to understand each individual organ system, it will also challenge you by asking you to think critically about how one system impacts another. By spending some time in your studies looking at these interactions, you will be one step ahead on Test Day. In our ﬁnal chapter of MCAT Biology Review, we will switch gears and look at the transfer of information from generation to generation. is picks up on a discussion from the ﬁrst three chapters of the book in which we explored the organization of cells and their genetic material, reproduction, and embryogenesis and development. In the next chapter, we’ll describe classical (Mendelian) inheritance and conclude with a note on how the gene pool can change over time with the topic of evolution. You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online The Muscular System ere are three main types of muscle: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle is involved in support and movement, propulsion of blood in the venous system, and thermoregulation. It appears striated, is under voluntary (somatic) control, is polynucleated, and can be divided into red (slow-twitch) ﬁbers that carry out oxidative phosphorylation and white (fast-twitch) ﬁbers that rely on Smooth muscle is in the respiratory, reproductive, cardiovascular, and digestive systems.
*$%pass: It appears nonstriated, is under involuntary (autonomic) control, and is uninucleated. It can display myogenic activity, or contraction without neural input. Cardiac muscle comprises the contractile tissue of the heart. It appears striated, is under involuntary (autonomic) control, and is uninucleated (sometimes binucleated). It can also display myogenic activity. Cells are connected with intercalated discs that contain gap e sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of striated muscle. Sarcomeres are made of thick (myosin) and thin (actin) ﬁlaments. Troponin and tropomyosin are found on the thin ﬁlament and regulate actin–myosin interactions. e sarcomere can be divided into diﬀerent lines, zones, and bands. e boundaries of each sarcomere are deﬁned by Z-lines. e M-line is located in the middle of the sarcomere. e I-band contains only thin ﬁlaments. e H-zone consists of only thick ﬁlaments. e A-band contains the thick ﬁlaments in their entirety. It is the only part of the sarcomere that maintains a constant size during Sarcomeres attach end-to-end to become myoﬁbrils, and each myocyte (muscle cell or muscle ﬁber) contains many myoﬁbrils. Myoﬁbrils are surrounded by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a calcium-containing modiﬁed endoplasmic reticulum, and the cell membrane of a myocyte is known as the sarcolemma. A system of T-tubules is connected to the sarcolemma and oriented perpendicularly to the myoﬁbrils, allowing the action potential to reach all parts of the muscle. Muscle contraction begins at the neuromuscular junction, where the motor neuron releases acetylcholine that binds to receptors on the sarcolemma, causing depolarization. is depolarization spreads down the sarcolemma to the T-tubules, triggering the release of calcium ions. Calcium binds to troponin, causing a shi in tropomyosin and exposure of the myosin-binding sites on the actin thin ﬁlament.
*$%pass: Shortening of the sarcomere occurs as myosin heads bind to the exposed sites on actin, forming cross bridges and pulling the actin ﬁlament along the thick ﬁlament, which results in contraction. is is known as the sliding ﬁlament model. e muscle relaxes when acetylcholine is degraded by acetylcholinesterase, terminating the signal and allowing calcium to be brought back into the SR. ATP binds to the myosin head, allowing it to release from actin. Muscle cells exhibit an all-or-nothing response called a simple twitch. Addition of multiple simple twitches before the muscle has an opportunity to fully relax is called frequency summation. Simple twitches that occur so frequently as to not let the muscle relax at all can lead to tetanus, a more prolonged and stronger contraction. Muscle cells have additional energy reserves to reduce oxygen debt (the diﬀerence between the amount of oxygen needed and the amount present) and forestall fatigue. Creatine phosphate can transfer a phosphate group to ADP, forming Myoglobin is a heme-containing protein that is a muscular oxygen The Skeletal System Internal skeletons (like those in humans) are called endoskeletons; external skeletons (like those in arthropods) are called exoskeletons. e human skeletal system can be divided into axial and appendicular e axial skeleton consists of structures in the midline such as the skull, vertebral column, rib cage, and hyoid bone. e appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvis. Bone is derived from embryonic mesoderm and includes both compact and spongy (cancellous) types. Compact bone provides strength and is dense. Spongy or cancellous bone has a lattice-like structure consisting of bony spicules known as trabeculae. e cavities are ﬁlled with bone Long bones contain shas called diaphyses that ﬂare to form metaphyses and terminate in epiphyses.
*$%pass: e epiphysis contains an epiphyseal (growth) plate that causes linear growth of the bone. Bone is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called periosteum. Bones are attached to muscles by tendons and to each other by Bone matrix has both organic components, like collagen, glycoproteins, and other peptides; and inorganic components, like Bone is organized into concentric rings called lamellae around a central Haversian or Volkmann’s canal. is structural unit is called an osteon or Haversian system. Between lamellar rings are lacunae, where osteocytes reside, which are connected with canaliculi to allow for nutrient and waste Bone remodeling is carried out by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts build bone, while osteoclasts resorb bone. Parathyroid hormone increases resorption of bone, increasing calcium and phosphate concentrations in the blood. Vitamin D also increases resorption of bone, leading to increased turnover and, subsequently, the production of stronger bone. Calcitonin increases bone formation, decreasing calcium concentrations in the blood. Cartilage is a ﬁrm, elastic material secreted by chondrocytes. Its matrix is called chondrin. Cartilage is usually found in areas that require more ﬂexibility or Cartilage is avascular and is not innervated. In fetal life, bone forms from cartilage through endochondral ossiﬁcation. Some bones, especially those of the skull, form directly from undiﬀerentiated tissue (mesenchyme) in intramembranous Joints may be classiﬁed as immovable or movable. Immovable joints are fused together to form sutures or similar Movable joints are usually strengthened by ligaments and contain a Synovial ﬂuid, secreted by the synovium, aids in motion by lubricating the joint. Each bone in the joint is coated with articular cartilage to aid in movement and provide cushioning. Muscles that serve opposite functions come in antagonistic pairs; when one muscle contracts, the other lengthens. Answers to Concept Checks 1. Skeletal and cardiac muscle are striated.
*$%pass: Smooth muscle is always uninucleated. Skeletal muscle is always polynucleated. Skeletal muscle is voluntary. Smooth and cardiac muscle are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Smooth and cardiac muscle exhibit myogenic activity. 2. e A-band does not change length during muscle contraction because it is the entire length of the myosin ﬁlament. e ﬁlaments do not change length, but rather slide over each other; thus, the A-band should remain a constant length during contraction. 3. Release of acetylcholine from motor neuron activation of acetylcholine receptors in sarcolemma depolarization of sarcolemma spreading of signal using T-tubules release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) binding of calcium to troponin conformational shi in tropomyosin exposure of myosin-binding sites myosin binds to actin 4. ATP binding allows the myosin ﬁlament to disconnect from actin. Dissociation of ADP and inorganic phosphate from myosin causes the 5. Tetanus is the summation of multiple simple twitches that occur too quickly for the muscle to relax. is leads to a stronger and more prolonged contraction of the muscle. 1. Compact bone is dense and is used for its strength; it forms most of the outer layers of a bone. Spongy (cancellous) bone has many spaces between bony spicules called trabeculae and is the site of marrow production. It is found in the interior core of the bone and also helps distribute forces or pressures on the bone. 2. e three parts of a bone are the diaphysis, metaphysis, and epiphysis. Growth plates are found in epiphyses and contribute to linear growth. 3. Most inorganic bone is composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. 4. Osteoblasts build bone. Osteoclasts “chew” bone (break it down). Chondrocytes form cartilage. 5. Synovial ﬂuid, produced by the synovium, lubricates movable joints.
*$%pass: Science Mastery Assessment Explanations We are given a diagram of a sarcomere and asked to determine which regions shorten during muscle contraction. All bands and zones of the sarcomere shorten during contraction except the A-band, which is the full length of the thick ﬁlaments. In this diagram, that is region 1. us, the remaining regions all shorten, making (D) the correct answer. Region 2 represents the I-band, region 3 represents the H-zone, and region 4 is the length of the sarcomere between Region 1 contains both thick and thin ﬁlaments overlapping each other. is region refers to the A-band and is measured from one end of the thick ﬁlaments to the other. is is also the only portion of the sarcomere that does not change length during muscle contraction. e sarcomere is the contractile unit in striated muscle cells. One sarcomere is represented by the area between the two vertical lines, referred to as the Z-lines. In addition, the Z-lines anchor the thin ﬁlaments. In the diagram, a sarcomere is therefore deﬁned by region 4. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm. It binds the troponin molecules on the thin ﬁlaments, causing the strands of tropomyosin to shi, thereby exposing the myosin-binding sites on the thin ﬁlaments. Let’s quickly deﬁne each one of the four cells discussed in the answer choices. Osteoblasts are bone cells involved in the secretion of bone matrix, as (A) states. Osteoclasts are large, polynucleated cells involved in bone resorption. Osteocytes are mature bone cells that eventually become surrounded by their matrix; their primary role is bone maintenance. Finally, chondrocytes are cells that secrete chondrin, an elastic matrix that makes up cartilage. is question is essentially asking where longitudinal growth occurs in bones.
*$%pass: e most likely site of abnormalities in this child’s femur is the epiphyseal plate, a disc of cartilaginous cells at the internal border of the epiphysis, because the epiphyseal plate is the site of longitudinal growth. Damage to the epiphysis (with or without metaphysis involvement) can imply damage to the epiphyseal plate. Red ﬁbers are slow-twitching ﬁbers that have high levels of myoglobin and many mitochondria. ey derive their energy from aerobic respiration and are capable of sustained vigorous activity. is eliminates (A) and (B). White ﬁbers, on the other hand, are fast-twitching ﬁbers and contain lower levels of myoglobin and fewer mitochondria. Because of their composition, they derive more of their energy anaerobically and fatigue more easily. is eliminates (C) and makes (D) the correct answer. e articular surfaces of the bones are covered with a layer of smooth articular cartilage. e epiphysis is a portion of the bone itself, eliminating (B). Synovial ﬂuid lubricates the movement in the joint space, but does not stop the bones from contacting one another; this is the job of articular cartilage, eliminating (C). ere is no appreciable function for smooth muscle in the joint space, eliminating (D). e only type of muscle that is always multinucleated is skeletal muscle, making (B) the correct answer. Cardiac muscle may contain one or two centrally located nuclei, so Statement I is incorrect. Smooth muscle, on the other hand, always has only one centrally located nucleus. Myogenic activity refers to the ability of a muscle to contract without nervous stimulation, such as in response to other stimuli like stretching.
*$%pass: Smooth and cardiac muscle both possess Yellow marrow is largely inactive and is inﬁltrated by adipose tissue, making (D) the correct e periosteum, a ﬁbrous sheath that surrounds long bones, is the site of attachment to muscle tissue. Some periosteum cells are capable of diﬀerentiating into bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. is eliminates (A), (B), and (C). It is the synovium that secretes ﬂuid into the joint cavity (joint space), not the periosteum, making (D) the correct answer. e axial skeleton includes the skull, vertebral column, rib cage, and hyoid bone. e sternum is a point of attachment of the rib cage and is thus a part of the axial, not appendicular, skeleton. e limb bones, pectoral girdle, and pelvis are all part of the appendicular skeleton. Bones form in one of two ways: endochondral ossiﬁcation and intramembranous ossiﬁcation. Endochondral ossiﬁcation is the replacement of cartilage with bone and occurs mostly in long bones, eliminating (A). Intramembranous ossiﬁcation is the formation of bone from undiﬀerentiated connective tissue cells (mesenchyme) and occurs mostly in the skull, making (B) the correct answer. Bone resorption is the breakdown of bone, not its formation, eliminating (C). Longitudinal growth occurs in long bones and is responsible for increasing height over time, but does not play a role in fontanelle ossiﬁcation, eliminating (D). An unprovoked fracture of the hip is not a normal ﬁnding in a person who is younger. Given that the patient has a high calcium level, it is likely that the patient has an increased level of bone resorption that is causing the bones to be more fragile. Parathyroid hormone causes calcium release from bones.
*$%pass: If this patient had an overactive parathyroid gland—or even cancer in this gland—then it is likely that calcium could still be resorbed from the bones even though blood calcium levels are already high.

*$%pass: A child is born with a number of rare phenotypic features and genetic testing is performed. The child is determined to have partial trisomy 21, with three copies of some segments of DNA from chromosome 21, and partial monosomy 4, with only one copy of some segments of DNA from chromosome 4. Which of the following mutations could have occurred in one of the parental gametes during development to explain both findings? Genetics and Evolution In This Chapter Fundamental Concepts of Genetics Patterns of Dominance Penetrance and Expressivity DNA as Genetic Material Changes in the Gene Pool Analytical Approaches in Genetics Measuring Evolutionary Time The content in this chapter should be relevant to about 13% of all questions about biology on the MCAT. This chapter covers material from the following AAMC content category: 1C: Transmission of heritable information from generation to generation and the processes that increase genetic diversity For generations, European royal families practiced what is known as royal intermarriage. For purposes of establishing or continuing political alliances, maintaining bloodline purity, or smoothing out diplomatic relations, marriages between royal families were arranged, resulting in such an interweaving of bloodlines that eventually much of European royalty was— and still is—genetically related. Such marriage unions led to rather severe restrictions on the gene pool, or all the alleles represented in the royal family lines. Oﬀspring of parents who were also related to each other through blood lineage (consanguinity) came to have greater similarities in their genotypes, and certain alleles became so frequent that their phenotypic expression became almost a hallmark of royal descent. e House of Habsburg, which ruled a number of European kingdoms from the 11th century until the late 18th century, was perhaps the most infamous for its inbreeding practices.
*$%pass: Members of this royal family bore the unmistakable mark of their restricted genes through a jaw malformation that even came to be known as the Habsburg lip. Medically termed prognathism (Greek: “forward jaw”), the condition is a misalignment of the mandible forward-thrusting lower jaws and chins characteristic of mandibular prognathism. e genetic condition has more than just aesthetic implications; it can lead to serious disﬁgurement and disability. Charles II of Spain suﬀered from the worst case of the Habsburg lip on record—his lower teeth protruded so much farther than his upper teeth that he was not able to chew his food. In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of classical genetics, which were originally described in the mid-1800s. Consider this chapter in tandem with the discussions of molecular genetics in Chapters 6 and 7 of MCAT Biochemistry Review. en, we will explore the changes in the gene pool that occur over time with a discussion of evolution. We’ll also quantify the genetics of populations that are not undergoing evolution with the Hardy– Fundamental Concepts of Genetics After Chapter 12.1, you will be able to: Recall what traits make alleles dominant or recessive Differentiate between homozygous, heterozygous, and hemizygous genotypes Compare and contrast complete dominance, codominance, and incomplete Explain the difference between penetrance and expressivity Connect Mendel’s laws with the phase of meiosis to which they are most closely Blood type A individuals carry the A antigen on their erythrocytes and have circulating anti-B antibodies. Blood type B individuals carry the B antigen on their erythrocytes and have circulating anti-A antibodies. Those with type AB have both antigens and neither antibody; those with type O have neither antigen and both antibodies. That makes type O individuals universal donors and type AB individuals universal recipients.
*$%pass: Blood typing is discussed in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biology Review. e physical and biochemical characteristics of every living organism are determined by genes, which are DNA sequences that code for heritable traits that can be passed from one generation to the next. Taken together, all genes (as well as a large supply of noncoding DNA) are organized into chromosomes to ensure that genetic material is passed easily to daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis. Each gene may have alternative forms called alleles. We’ve already explored the ABO blood antigens as an example of three alleles for the same gene (IA, IB, and i). e genetic combination possessed by an individual is known as a genotype, and the manifestation of a given genotype as an observable trait is known as a phenotype. Human beings typically possess two copies of each chromosome, called homologues, with the exception of the sex chromosomes of genotypical males, who have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Each gene has a particular locus, or location on a speciﬁc chromosome. e normal locus of a particular gene is consistent among human beings—a gene can be described by its location. Because each chromosome is part of a homologous pair, a person will inherit two alleles for all genes (again, except for male sex chromosomes). Alleles can be categorized based on their expression. If only one copy of an allele is needed to express a given phenotype, the allele is said to be dominant and is usually represented with a capital letter. If two copies are needed, the allele is said to be recessive and is usually represented with a lowercase letter. If both alleles are the same for a given gene, the individual is said to have a homozygous genotype.
*$%pass: If the alleles are diﬀerent, the individual has a heterozygous genotype. A hemizygous genotype describes a situation in which only one allele is present for a given gene, as is the case for parts of the X chromosome in genotypical males. Patterns of Dominance When only one dominant and one recessive allele exist for a given gene, there is said to be complete dominance. In this case, the presence of one dominant allele will mask the recessive allele, if present. When more than one dominant allele exists for a given gene, there is codominance. For example, a person with one allele for the A blood antigen and one allele for the B blood antigen will express both antigens simultaneously. Finally, incomplete dominance occurs when a heterozygote expresses a phenotype that is intermediate between the two homozygous genotypes. A classic example of incomplete dominance is the mating of certain ﬂowers, in which a red ﬂower crossed with a white ﬂower results in pink ﬂowers, as shown in Figure 12.1 Incomplete Dominance Snapdragons display incomplete dominance, in which neither allele is dominant and the heterozygous phenotype is a mixture of the two Penetrance and Expressivity Penetrance and expressivity both reveal the complex interplay between genes and the environment. Penetrance is a population measure deﬁned as the proportion of individuals in the population carrying the allele who actually express the phenotype. In other words, it is the probability that, given a particular genotype, a person will express the phenotype. Alleles can be classiﬁed by their degree of penetrance; Huntington’s disease, caused by an expansion of a repetitive sequence in the huntingtin gene, is a classic example. Individuals with more than 40 sequence repeats have full penetrance—100 percent of individuals with this allele show symptoms of Huntington’s disease.
*$%pass: Individuals with fewer sequence repeats show high penetrance, wherein most (but not all) of those with the allele show symptoms of the disease. With fewer sequence repeats, the gene comes to have reduced penetrance, low penetrance, or even nonpenetrance. Penetrance—the proportion of the population with a given genotype who actually express the phenotype Expressivity—the different manifestations of the same genotype across the A related but distinct concept is expressivity, which is deﬁned as varying phenotypes despite identical genotypes. If expressivity is constant, then all individuals with a given genotype express the same phenotype. However, if expressivity is variable, then individuals with the same genotype may have diﬀerent phenotypes. Whereas penetrance is a population parameter (what percentage of individuals with a given genotype express the phenotype?), expressivity reﬂects the gray area in expression and is more commonly considered at the individual level. For example, the disease neuroﬁbromatosis type II is an autosomal dominant disease that results from a mutation of the gene NF2 (merlin). Interestingly, a range of phenotypes is associated with carrying the defective allele. Many patients have debilitating tumors of the vestibulocochlear nerve, which is needed for hearing and balance. Some have cataracts, while others have tumors in the skin called neuromas; still others have spinal lesions. A small proportion of the population is nonpenetrant. e disease shows variable expressivity because presentations range from no clinical eﬀect to severe disability. Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian friar, developed several of the tenets of genetics in the 1860s based on his work with pea plants. While the study of genetics has come a long way, from pedigree analysis to DNA probes to whole-genome sequencing, many of Mendel’s original ideas still hold.
*$%pass: Mendel’s First Law: Law of Segregation ere are four basic tenets of the modern interpretation of Mendel’s ﬁrst law (of segregation), some which have already been discussed: Genes exist in alternative forms (alleles). An organism has two alleles for each gene—one inherited from each e two alleles segregate during meiosis, resulting in gametes that carry only one allele for any inherited trait. If two alleles of an organism are diﬀerent, only one will be fully expressed and the other will be silent. e expressed allele is said to be dominant, while the silent allele is recessive. (Keep in mind that codominance and incomplete dominance are exceptions to this rule.) e key cellular correlate to draw here is the separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I of meiosis. By separating—segregating— these chromosomes into diﬀerent cells, each gamete carries only one allele for any given trait. Mendel’s Second Law: Law of Independent Assortment Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment) states that the inheritance of one gene does not aﬀect the inheritance of another gene. Remember from Chapter 2 of MCAT Biology Review that spermatogonia and oogonia undergo genome replication before meiosis I. e daughter DNA strand is held to the parent strand at the centromere. Together, these DNA strands are known as sister chromatids. During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up to form tetrads, which derive their name from the four chromatids involved (two chromatids in each of two homologous chromosomes). Small segments of genetic material are swapped between chromatids in homologous chromosomes, resulting in novel combinations of alleles that were not present in the original chromosomes (recombination). is allows the inheritance of one gene to be independent of the inheritance of all others. Mendel’s second law has been complicated by the discovery of linked genes.
*$%pass: We will discuss nonindependent assortment and linkage later in this chapter in the section on analytical approaches in genetics. Both segregation of homologous chromosomes and independent assortment of alleles increase the genetic diversity of gametes and, subsequently, the genetic diversity of oﬀspring. is has been demonstrated to improve the ability of a species to evolve and adapt to environmental stresses. Segregation and independent assortment allow for greater genetic diversity in the offspring. DNA as Genetic Material While Mendel noticed there were certain patterns of inheritance, what he did not know was that DNA was the genetic material transferred to oﬀspring and that genes were made of DNA. In fact, the scientiﬁc community rejected Mendel’s initial papers on inheritance. It wasn’t until the early 1900s that his work was rediscovered. In the early to mid-1900s, it was largely believed that protein was the heritable material. In the mid-1900s, there were three experiments conducted that largely pointed to DNA’s role in genetic In the 1920s, Frederick Griﬃth was a scientist working for the British government, studying Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria that causes pneumonia. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were identiﬁed: a virulent (disease-causing) strain and a nonvirulent strain. In successive trials, Griﬃth exposed mice to these strains of bacteria under diﬀerent conditions and observed whether the mice lived or died, as shown in Figure 12.2. e virulent S. pneumonia has a smooth capsule that helps the bacterium evade the immune system and cause disease. He injected this strain into mice, which resulted in death of the mice. Naturally, if the virulent bacteria were killed prior to injection, no disease resulted. Likewise, exposure of the mice to the nonvirulent strain, which has a rough capsule, did not cause disease.
*$%pass: However, when both dead virulent bacteria and live nonvirulent bacteria were injected into the mouse, the mouse died and live bacteria with smooth capsules could be found in the mice. He theorized that the live, nonvirulent bacteria must have acquired the ability to form smooth capsules from the dead virulent bacteria. is was known as the transforming principle. Figure 12.2 The Griffith Experiment The transforming principle described in Griffith’s experiment is the same as bacterial transformation discussed in Chapter 1 of MCAT Biology Review. Remember that transformation is one of three main ways bacteria increase genetic variability; the other two are conjugation and transduction. Researchers at the Rockefeller Institute conﬁrmed the transformation principle. ree American scientists—Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty—were attempting to identify the exact material underlying the transformation principle. ese scientists puriﬁed a very large quantity of heat-killed virulent S. pneumoniae bacteria and separated the subcellular components of the bacteria into diﬀerent extracts. It was noted that the addition of one particular extract to nonvirulent S. pneumoniae transformed the bacteria and enabled them to kill the mouse when injected. When this substance was treated with enzymes known to degrade DNA, the bacteria were not transformed and the mice lived. However, when the substance was treated with enzymes known to degrade proteins, the bacteria were still transformed and the mice died. us, the group concluded that the transforming substance must be DNA. Radiolabeling sulfur was an appropriate choice to tag proteins in the Hershey–Chase experiment. Recall from Chapter 1 of MCAT Biochemistry Review that two amino acids— cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur in their R group, while no nucleotides contain any In 1952 (one year before the description of the Watson–Crick model), Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase worked to conﬁrm the idea that DNA could independently carry genetic information.
*$%pass: ese scientists created bacteriophages with radiolabeled DNA and protein. One group of bacteriophages contained radiolabeled sulfur, which is found in protein but not in DNA. Another group contained radiolabeled phosphorus, which is found in DNA but not in protein. Each of these bacteriophages was permitted to infect a group of nonlabeled bacteria. Recall from Chapter 1 of MCAT Biology Review that when bacteriophages infect a bacterium, they inject their genetic material into the cell and leave their capsid outside. Aer the phages and bacteria were incubated, the sample was centrifuged to separate the material that remained outside the cell from the bacterial cells themselves. It was determined that while no radiolabeled protein entered the cells, radiolabeled DNA had. It was known that viruses must enter a cell to cause disease and replicate, so this experiment once again helped conﬁrm that DNA was the heritable genetic material.

What does it mean for a genotype to be homozygous? Heterozygous? 3. What is the difference between complete dominance, codominance, and 4. What is the difference between penetrance and expressivity? 5. With which phase of meiosis does each of Mendel’s laws most closely correlate?
*$%pass: Mendel’s first law: Mendel’s second law: Changes in the Gene Pool After Chapter 12.2, you will be able to: Identify the three main types of point mutations and the genetic changes they are Recall the two main types of frameshift mutation Explain why genetic leakage would increase within the last century Describe the relationship between genetic drift, small population, and the founder Identify the main types of chromosomal mutation and the impact they have at the All of the alleles that exist within a species are known as the gene pool. When mutations or genetic leakage occur, new genes are introduced into the gene pool. Genetic variability is essential for the survival of a species because it allows it to evolve to adapt to changing environmental stresses. Certain traits may be more desirable than others and confer a selective advantage that allows for an individual to produce more viable, fertile oﬀspring. In this section, we will consider genetic diversity and mutations, leakage, and genetic dri, which cause changes to the alleles or their frequency in the A mutation is a change in DNA sequence, and it results in a mutant allele. Mutant alleles can be contrasted with their wild-type counterparts, which are alleles that are considered “normal” or “natural” and are ubiquitous in the study population. New mutations may be introduced in a variety of ways. Ionizing radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun, and chemical exposures can damage DNA; substances that can cause mutations are called mutagens. DNA polymerase is subject to making mistakes during DNA replication, albeit at a very low rate; proofreading mechanisms help prevent mutations from occurring through this mechanism. Elements known as transposons can insert and remove themselves from the genome.
*$%pass: If a transposon inserts in the middle of a coding sequence, the mutation will disrupt the gene. Flawed proteins can arise in other ways without an underlying change in DNA sequence. Incorrect pairing of nucleotides during transcription or translation, or a tRNA molecule charged with the incorrect amino acid for its anticodon, can result in derangements of the normal amino acid e major types of nucleotide-level mutations are discussed in great detail in Chapter 7 of MCAT Biochemistry Review, so we oﬀer just a brief overview here of each type. Many mutations occur at the level of a single nucleotide (or a very small number of nucleotides). ese mutations are shown in Figure 12.3 and are Figure 12.3 Common Nucleotide-Level Mutations Point mutations occur when one nucleotide in DNA (A, C, T, or G) is swapped for another. ese can be subcategorized as silent, missense, or Silent mutations occur when the change in nucleotide has no eﬀect on the ﬁnal protein synthesized from the gene. is most commonly occurs when the changed nucleotide is transcribed to be the third nucleotide in a codon because there is degeneracy (wobble) in the Missense mutations occur when the change in nucleotide results in substituting one amino acid for another in the ﬁnal protein. Nonsense mutations occur when the change in nucleotide results in substituting a stop codon for an amino acid in the ﬁnal protein. Frameshi mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted into or deleted from the genome. Because mRNA transcribed from DNA is always read in three-letter sequences called codons, insertion or deletion of nucleotides can shi the reading frame, usually resulting in either changes in the amino acid sequence or premature truncation of the protein (due to the generation of a nonsense mutation).
*$%pass: ese can be subcategorized as insertion or Chromosomal mutations are larger-scale mutations in which large segments of DNA are aﬀected, as demonstrated in Figure 12.4 and Figure 12.4 Common Chromosomal Mutations Deletion mutations occur when a large segment of DNA is lost from a chromosome. Small deletion mutations are considered frameshi mutations, as described previously. Duplication mutations occur when a segment of DNA is copied multiple times in the genome. Inversion mutations occur when a segment of DNA is reversed within the chromosome. Insertion mutations occur when a segment of DNA is moved from one chromosome to another. Small insertion mutations (including those where the inserted DNA is not from another chromosome) are considered frameshi mutations, as described previously. Translocation mutations occur when a segment of DNA from one chromosome is swapped with a segment of DNA from another Consequences of Mutations Mutations can have many diﬀerent consequences. Some mutations can be advantageous, conferring a positive selective advantage that may allow the organism to produce ﬁtter oﬀspring. For example, sickle cell disease is a single nucleotide mutation that causes sickled hemoglobin. While the disease itself is detrimental to life, heterozygotes for sickle cell disease usually have minor symptoms, if any, and have natural resistance to malaria because their red blood cells have a slightly shorter lifespan—just short enough that the parasitic Plasmodium species that causes malaria cannot reproduce in them. us, heterozygotes for sickle cell disease have a selective advantage because they are less likely to die from malaria. On the other hand, some mutations can be detrimental or deleterious. For example, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an inherited defect in the nucleotide excision repair mechanism. In patients with XP, DNA that has been damaged by ultraviolet radiation cannot be repaired appropriately.
*$%pass: Ultraviolet radiation can introduce cancer-causing mutations; since they lack a repair mechanism, patients with XP are frequently diagnosed with malignancies, especially of the skin. One important class of deleterious mutations is known as inborn errors of metabolism. ese are deﬁciencies in genes required for metabolism. Children born with these deﬁcient genes oen require very early intervention in order to prevent permanent damage from the buildup of metabolites in various pathways. For example, in phenylketonuria (PKU), the enzyme phenylalanine hydrolase, which completes the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine, is defective. In the absence of this enzyme, toxic metabolites of phenylalanine accumulate, causing seizures, impairment of cerebral function, and learning disabilities, as well as a musty odor to bodily secretions. However, if the disease is discovered shortly aer birth, then dietary phenylalanine can be eliminated and treatments can be administered to aid in metabolizing any remaining phenylalanine. Genetic leakage is a ﬂow of genes between species. In some cases, individuals from diﬀerent (but closely related) species can mate to produce hybrid oﬀspring. Many hybrid oﬀspring, such as the mule (hybrid of a male horse and a female donkey), are not able to reproduce because they have odd numbers of chromosomes—horses have 64 chromosomes and donkeys have 62, so mules, with 63 chromosomes, cannot undergo normal homologous pairing in meiosis and cannot form gametes. In some cases, however, a hybrid can reproduce with members of one species or the other, such as the beefalo (a cross between cattle and American bison). e hybrid carries genes from both parent species, so this can result in a net ﬂow of genes from one species to the other. Genetic dri refers to changes in the composition of the gene pool due to chance. Genetic dri tends to be more pronounced in small populations.
*$%pass: e founder eﬀect is a more extreme case of genetic dri in which a small population of a species ﬁnds itself in reproductive isolation from other populations as a result of natural barriers, catastrophic events, or other bottlenecks that drastically and suddenly reduce the size of the population available for breeding. Because the breeding group is small, inbreeding, or mating between two genetically related individuals, may occur in later generations. Inbreeding encourages homozygosity, which increases the prevalence of both homozygous dominant and recessive genotypes. Ultimately, genetic dri, the founder eﬀect, and inbreeding cause a reduction in genetic diversity, which is oen the reason why a small population may have increased prevalence of certain traits and diseases. For example, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deﬁciency (also called maple syrup urine disease) is especially common in Mennonite communities; this implies a common origin of the mutation, which may have been in a very small original population. is loss of genetic variation may cause reduced ﬁtness of the population, a condition known as inbreeding depression. On the opposite end of the spectrum, out-breeding or outcrossing is the introduction of unrelated individuals into a breeding group. eoretically, this could result in increased variation within a gene pool and increased ﬁtness of the MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 12.2 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1. What are the three main types of point mutations? What change occurs in each? 2. What are the two main types of frameshift mutations? 3. What are the three main types of chromosomal mutations that do NOT share their name with a type of frameshift mutation? What change occurs in each? 4. Why would genetic leakage in animals be rare prior to the last century? 5. Why is genetic drift more common in small populations?
*$%pass: What relationship does this have to the founder effect? Analytical Approaches in Genetics After Chapter 12.3, you will be able to: Predict the phenotype ratio in the offspring of a cross, such as AaBB × AAbb Order genes on a chromosome given their recombination frequencies Recall the five criteria of the Hardy–Weinberg principle and the underlying population characteristic each one implies Solve calculation problems requiring use of the Hardy–Weinberg equations: p + q = 1, and p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 Genetics is a ﬁeld in which a number of biometric techniques, or quantitative approaches to biological data, have been developed. ese range from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Punnett squares are diagrams that predict the relative genotypic and phenotypic frequencies that will result from the crossing of two individuals. e alleles of the two parents are arranged on the top and side of the square, with the genotypes of the progeny represented at the intersections of these alleles. e genotypes of the progeny will be the product of the two parental Pedigree (or family tree) analysis was once a mainstay of MCAT passages and questions. While this topic no longer appears on the exam, it will appear in your medical school genetics studies. The symbology of pedigree analysis is complex and intricate, but a great deal of information can be gleaned from a well-drawn pedigree. In genetics problems, including those on the MCAT, dominant alleles are assigned capital letters and recessive alleles are assigned lowercase letters. If both copies of the allele are the same, that individual is said to be homozygous; if they are diﬀerent, the individual is heterozygous. A cross in which only one trait is being studied is said to be monohybrid.
*$%pass: e parent or P generation refers to the individuals being crossed; the oﬀspring are the ﬁlial or F generation. Multiple generations can be denoted F generations by using numeric subscripts. If you think of your grandparents as the P generation, then your parents are in the F1 generation, and you are in the F2 generation. Mendel worked with pea plants that had either purple or white ﬂowers. Before crossing the diﬀerent plants, each group contained homozygotes; subsequent experimentation revealed that the allele for purple color was dominant (P) and the allele for white color was recessive (p). us, crossing a homozygous purple ﬂower with a white ﬂower would be crossing PP with pp, resulting in an F1 generation that contained 100 percent Pp or heterozygotes, as shown in Figure 12.5. All of the ﬂowers in this generation would be purple because P is a dominant allele. Figure 12.5 Punnett Square of Homozygous Parents If two members of the F1 generation were crossed, the resulting oﬀspring in the F2 generation would be more genotypically and phenotypically diverse than their parents. Crossing two plants with the genotype Pp would result in 25 percent PP, 50 percent Pp, and 25 percent pp oﬀspring, as shown in Figure 12.6. Phenotypically, this would be a 3:1 distribution because both the homozygous dominant and heterozygous dominant oﬀspring would be purple-ﬂowering plants. us, crossing two heterozygotes in a case of complete dominance will result in a 1:2:1 distribution of genotypes (homozygous phenotypes (dominant:recessive). ese ratios are, of course, theoretical probabilities and will not always hold true—especially in a small population of oﬀspring. Usually, the more oﬀspring parents have, the closer their phenotypic ratios will be to the expected ratios.
*$%pass: Figure 12.6 Punnett Square of Heterozygous Parents Crossing two heterozygotes for a trait with complete dominance results in a 1:2:1 ratio of genotypes and a 3:1 ratio of phenotypes. Know these ratios cold for Test Day! The ability to create and read a Punnett square quickly on Test Day is one of the most useful skills for questions involving Mendelian inheritance. Often, an entire passage in the Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems section will be devoted to classical and molecular genetics and will require the use of at least one Punnett square. A test cross is used to determine an unknown genotype, as shown in Figure 12.7. In a test cross, the organism with an unknown genotype is crossed with an organism known to be homozygous recessive. If all of the oﬀspring (100 percent) are of the dominant phenotype, then the unknown genotype is likely to be homozygous dominant. If there is a 1:1 distribution of dominant to recessive phenotypes, then the unknown genotype is likely to be heterozygous. Because a test cross is used to determine the genotype of the parent based on the phenotypes of its oﬀspring, test crosses are sometimes called back crosses. Figure 12.7 Test Cross An organism with an unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive organism to identify the unknown genotype using the phenotypes of the resulting offspring. We can extend a Punnett square to account for the inheritance of two diﬀerent genes using a dihybrid cross. Remember, according to Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment) the inheritance of one gene is independent of the inheritance of the other. is will hold true for unlinked genes, although it will be more complicated for linked genes, as described later in this chapter.
*$%pass: If we expand the previous crosses to consider not only ﬂower color, but also plant height, then we can create a 4 × 4 Punnett square as shown in Figure 12.8. Remember that purple is dominant (P) and white is recessive (p); similarly, tall is dominant (T) and short or dwarf is recessive (t). If we cross two plants that are heterozygous for both traits, then the oﬀspring have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 (9 tall and purple:3 tall and white:3 dwarf and purple:1 dwarf and white). Note that the 3:1 phenotypic ratio still holds for each trait (12 tall:4 dwarf and 12 purple:4 white), reﬂecting Mendel’s second Figure 12.8 Dihybrid Cross Just as with the 3:1 phenotypic ratio of a monohybrid cross, it is worth memorizing the When considering sex-linked (X-linked) traits, a slightly diﬀerent system is used to symbolize the various alleles because genotypical females have two X chromosomes and thus may be homozygous or heterozygous for a condition carried on the X chromosome. Genotypical males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and are hemizygous for many genes carried on the X chromosome. is is why sex-linked traits are much more common in genotypical males; having only one recessive allele is suﬃcient for expression of the recessive phenotype. On the MCAT, sex-linked is X-linked. Y-linked diseases exist, but are exceedingly rare. Further, unless told otherwise, assume that sex-linked traits are recessive. When writing genotypes for sex-linked traits, we use X and Y to symbolize normal X and Y chromosomes. An X chromosome carrying a defective allele is commonly given a subscript, such as Xh, to indicate the presence of the disease-carrying allele.
*$%pass: Hemophilia is a particularly common example of a sex-linked trait; Punnett squares for a heterozygous (carrier) female and both an unaﬀected (normal) male and aﬀected (hemophiliac) male are shown in Figure 12.9. Figure 12.9 Sex-Linked Cross Unless stated otherwise, assume that all sex-linked traits on the MCAT are X-linked Because an egg necessarily carries an X chromosome, the sperm determines the chromosomal or genotypical sex of a child. It follows that, for genotypical males with a sex- linked trait, genotypically female offspring will either carry the trait or express it, but genotypically male offspring will do neither (unless the X chromosome in the egg contains the affected allele, in which case they will express it). Genes are organized in a linear fashion on chromosomes. As discussed earlier, crossing over during prophase I of meiosis causes alleles to be swapped between homologous chromosomes, supporting Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment). However, genes that are located very close together on a chromosome are less likely to be separated from each other during crossing over. In other words, the further apart two genes are, the more likely it is that there will be a point of crossing over, called a chiasma, between them. e likelihood that two alleles are separated from each other during crossing over, called the recombination frequency (θ), is roughly proportional to the distance between the genes on the chromosome. We can also describe the strength of linkage between genes based on the recombination frequency: tightly linked genes have recombination frequencies close to 0 percent; weakly linked genes have recombination frequencies approaching 50 percent, as expected from independent By analyzing recombination frequencies, a genetic map representing the relative distance between genes on a chromosome can be constructed.
*$%pass: By convention, one map unit or centimorgan corresponds to a 1 percent chance of recombination occurring between two genes. us, if two genes were 25 map units apart, we would expect 25 percent of the total gametes examined to show recombination somewhere between these two genes. Recombination frequencies can be added in a crude approximation to determine the order of genes in the chromosome, as shown in Figure 12.10. Figure 12.10 Genetic Maps from Recombination Frequencies If the recombination frequencies are known, one can deduce the order of genes on the chromosome because map units are roughly additive. How oen an allele appears in a population is known as its allele frequency. For example, if we took a one-cell sample from 50 of Mendel’s plants, we could collect 100 copies of alleles for ﬂower color (two from each cell). If 75 of these alleles were the dominant allele, we could say that the allele frequency of P is 75 ¸ 100 = 0.75. Note that this does not indicate which ﬂowers contain the allele or if those ﬂowers are homozygous or heterozygous; it only tells us the representation of the allele across all chromosomes in the population. Evolution results from changes in these gene frequencies in reproducing populations over time. However, when the gene frequencies of a population are not changing, the gene pool is stable and evolution is ostensibly not occurring. e following ﬁve criteria are mandatory for this to be possible: e population is very large (no genetic dri). ere are no mutations that aﬀect the gene pool. Mating between individuals in the population is random (no sexual ere is no migration of individuals into or out of the population.
*$%pass: e genes in the population are all equally successful at being Provided that all of these conditions are met, the population is said to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and a pair of equations can be used to predict the allelic and phenotypic frequencies. Let us deﬁne a particular gene as having only two possible alleles, T and t. We will deﬁne p to be the frequency of the dominant allele T and q to be the frequency of the recessive allele t. Because there are only these two choices at the same gene locus, p + q = 1. at is, the combined allele frequencies of T and t must equal 100 percent. If we square both sides of the equation, we (p + q)2 = 12 p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 where p2 is the frequency of the TT (homozygous dominant) genotype, 2pq is the frequency of the Tt (heterozygous dominant) genotype, and q2 is the frequency of the tt (homozygous recessive) genotype. Note that the sum p2 + 2pq would represent the frequency of the dominant phenotype (both homozygous and heterozygous dominant genotypes). All you need to know to solve any MCAT Hardy–Weinberg problem is the value of p (or p2) or q (or q2). From there, you can calculate everything else using p + q = 1 and p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. For Test Day, you should know the two key Hardy–Weinberg equations p + q = 1 p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 Each equation provides us with diﬀerent information.
*$%pass: e ﬁrst tells us about the frequency of alleles in the population, whereas the second provides information about the frequency of genotypes and phenotypes in the The Hardy–Weinberg equations allow you to find two pieces of information: first, the relative frequency of alleles in a population, and second, the frequency of a given genotype or phenotype in the population. Remember that there will be twice as many alleles as individuals in a population because each individual has two autosomal copies of each gene. ese equations can also be used to demonstrate that evolution is not occurring in a population. Assuming that the conditions listed earlier are met, the allele frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. For example, imagine that we have a population of Mendel’s pea plants in which the frequency of the tall allele, T, is 0.80. is value is represented by p. is means that q (the short allele, t) is 0.20 by subtraction. Setting up our F1 cross for two heterozygotes, we can see the results of such We see that the ﬁlial generation contains 64 percent homozygous tall, 32 percent heterozygous tall, and 4 percent homozygous short plants. ese are the genotypic frequencies. We can determine the allele frequencies in this generation as follows: Notice that the allele frequencies are unchanged compared to the parent generation. T is still 0.80 and t is still 0.20. Populations in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium will exhibit this property. MCAT CONCEPT CHECK 12.3 Before you move on, assess your understanding of the material with these 1.

Signiﬁcant alterations to these initial theories have been made Natural selection, sometimes called survival of the ﬁttest, is the theory that certain characteristics or traits possessed by individuals within a species may help those individuals have greater reproductive success, thus passing on those traits to oﬀspring. is theory was originally proposed by Charles Darwin in his 1859 publication On the Origin of Species.
*$%pass: His theory was built on several basic tenets: Organisms produce oﬀspring, few of which survive to reproductive Chance variations within individuals in a population may be heritable. If these variations give an organism even a slight survival advantage, the variation is termed favorable. Individuals with a greater preponderance of these favorable variations are more likely to survive to reproductive age and produce oﬀspring; the overall result will be an increase in these traits in future generations. is level of reproductive success is termed ﬁtness, and an organism’s ﬁtness is directly related to the relative genetic contribution of this individual to the next generation. Darwin’s theory was ultimately proven to be correct in many ways— although not completely. In the 20th century, modern genetics led to the development of the currently accepted theory. e modern synthesis model, sometimes called neo-Darwinism, adds knowledge of genetic inheritance and changes in the gene pool to Darwin’s original theory. Once scientists showed that inheritance occurs through the passing of genes from parent to child and that genes ultimately change due to mutation or recombination, Darwin’s theory was updated to its current form: when mutation or recombination results in a change that is favorable to the organism’s reproductive success, that change is more likely to pass on to the next generation. e opposite is also true. is process is termed diﬀerential reproduction. Over time, those traits passed on by the more successful organisms will become ubiquitous in the gene pool. Because the gene pool changes over time, it is important to note that populations evolve, Evolution is not equivalent to natural selection. The MCAT likes to test your ability to understand that natural selection is simply a mechanism for evolution. Natural selection is, however, equivalent to survival of the fittest.
*$%pass: Also germane to the modernization of Darwin’s theory is a shi in scope to focus on inclusive ﬁtness over the ﬁtness of an individual organism. Inclusive ﬁtness is a measure of an organism’s success in the population, based on the number of oﬀspring, success in supporting oﬀspring, and the ability of the oﬀspring to then support others. Early descriptions of evolutionary success, like those of Darwin, were based solely on the number of viable oﬀspring of an organism. However, contemporary theories take into account the beneﬁts of certain behaviors on the population at large. For example, the existence of altruism could be supported by the observation that close relatives of an individual will share many of the same genes; thus, promoting the reproduction and survival of related or similar individuals can also lead to genetic success. Other species show examples of inclusive ﬁtness by protecting the oﬀspring of the group at large. By endangering themselves to protect the young, these organisms ensure the passing of genes to future generations. Inclusive ﬁtness therefore promotes the idea that altruistic behavior can improve the ﬁtness and success of a species as a One ﬁnal theory to consider was proposed as a result of research into the fossil record. Upon examination, it was discovered that little evolution would occur within a lineage of related lifeforms for long periods of time, followed by an explosion in evolutionary change. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed the theory of punctuated equilibrium to explain this in 1972. In contrast to Darwin’s theory, punctuated equilibrium suggests that changes in some species occur in rapid bursts rather than evenly over time. Modes of Natural Selection Natural selection may occur as stabilizing selection, directional selection, or disruptive selection, as shown in Figure 12.11.
*$%pass: Figure 12.11 Modes of Natural Selection Stabilizing selection keeps phenotypes within a speciﬁc range by selecting against extremes. For instance, human birth weight is maintained within a narrow band by stabilizing selection. Fetuses that weigh too little may not be healthy enough to survive, and fetuses that weigh too much can experience trauma during delivery through the relatively narrow birth canal. In addition, the larger the fetus, the more maternal resources it requires. For all of these reasons, there is a ﬁtness advantage to keeping birth weights within a narrow range. Adaptive pressure can lead to the emergence and dominance of an initially extreme phenotype through directional selection. For example, if we have a heterogeneous plate of bacteria, very few may have resistance to antibiotics. If the plate is then treated with ampicillin (an antibiotic), only those colonies that exhibit resistance to this antibiotic will survive. A new standard phenotype emerges as a result of diﬀerential survivorship. Natural selection is the history of diﬀerential survivorship over time. e emergence of mosquitoes resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a type of pesticide, is attributed to directional selection. In disruptive selection, two extreme phenotypes are selected over the norm. When Darwin studied ﬁnches on the Galapagos Islands, he noted that although there were many species, all the species arguably had a common ancestor, given their similar appearances. However, when he compared beak sizes they were all either large or small, as shown in Figure 12.12. No animals exhibited the intermediate phenotype of medium-size beaks. Darwin hypothesized that the sizes of seeds on the island (the ﬁnches’ food) led to this eﬀect. Seeds were either quite large or fairly small, requiring a large or small beak, respectively.
*$%pass: us, if the original ancestor had a medium-size beak, over time the animals with slightly larger or smaller beaks would be selected for. Disruptive selection is facilitated by the existence of polymorphisms—naturally occurring diﬀerences in form between members of the same population, such as light and dark coloration in the same species of butterﬂy. Adaptive radiation is a related concept that describes the rapid rise of a number of diﬀerent species from a common ancestor. e beneﬁt of adaptive radiation is that it allows for various species to occupy diﬀerent niches. A niche is a speciﬁc environment, including habitat, available resources, and predators, for which a species is speciﬁcally adapted. Adaptive radiation is favored by environmental changes or isolation of small groups of the ancestral species. Figure 12.12 Darwin’s Finches Image of Darwin’s finches as drawn by John Gould A species is deﬁned as the largest group of organisms capable of breeding to form fertile oﬀspring; the formation of a new species through evolution is called speciation. If we took two populations from the same species and separated them geographically for a long period of time, diﬀerent evolutionary pressures would lead to diﬀerent adaptive changes. If enough time passed, the changes would be suﬃcient to lead to isolation, which means the progeny of these populations could no longer freely interbreed. We would now consider the two groups separate species. Reproductive isolation may occur either prezygotically or postzygotically. Prezygotic mechanisms prevent formation of the zygote completely; postzygotic mechanisms allow for gamete fusion but yield either nonviable or sterile oﬀspring.
*$%pass: Examples of prezygotic mechanisms include temporal isolation (breeding at diﬀerent times), ecological isolation (living in diﬀerent niches within the same territory), behavioral isolation (a lack of attraction between members of the two species due to diﬀerences in pheromones, courtship displays, and so on), reproductive isolation (incompatibility of reproductive anatomy), or gametic isolation (intercourse can occur, but fertilization cannot). Postzygotic mechanisms include hybrid inviability (formation of a zygote that cannot develop to term), hybrid sterility (forming hybrid oﬀspring that cannot reproduce), and hybrid breakdown (forming ﬁrst-generation hybrid oﬀspring that are viable and fertile, but second-generation hybrid oﬀspring that are inviable or infertile). As described earlier in this chapter, mules are an example of postzygotic hybrid sterility. Although a horse and donkey can produce a viable mule, the mule will be sterile and thus unable to establish a self-perpetuating mule lineage. Patterns of Evolution When we look at similarities between two species, we must be careful to determine whether those similarities are due to sharing a common ancestor or sharing a common environment with the same evolutionary pressures. When analyzing species this way, three patterns of evolution emerge: divergent evolution, parallel evolution, and convergent evolution, as shown in Figure 12.13. Figure 12.13 Patterns of Evolution Divergent evolution refers to the independent development of dissimilar characteristics in two or more lineages sharing a common ancestor. For example, seals and cats are both mammals in the order Carnivora, yet they diﬀer markedly in general appearance. ese two species live in very diﬀerent environments and adapted to diﬀerent selection pressures while Parallel evolution refers to the process whereby related species evolve in similar ways for a long period of time in response to analogous environmental selection pressures.
*$%pass: Convergent evolution refers to the independent development of similar characteristics in two or more lineages not sharing a recent common ancestor. For example, ﬁsh and dolphins have come to resemble one another physically, though they belong to diﬀerent classes of vertebrates. ey evolved certain similar features in adapting to the conditions of aquatic life. Measuring Evolutionary Time Evolution is a slow process, featuring changes in the environment and subsequent changes in genotypes and phenotypes of a population over time. e rate of evolution is measured by the rate of change of a genotype over a period of time and is related to the severity of the evolutionary pressures on the species. In other words, if a species is already perfectly suited to its habitat and there are no changes to the conditions in which it lives, the rate of evolution will be exceedingly slow—although there will still be some small base rate of genetic mutation. On the other hand, if an organism lives in a rapidly changing environment, the rate of evolution will be greater, as selection for and against certain traits will be actively occurring within that By comparing DNA sequences between diﬀerent species, scientists can quantify the degree of similarity between two organisms. For example, chimpanzees share over 95 percent of their genome with humans, whereas mice share only about 70 percent. As species become more taxonomically distant, the proportion of the shared genome will decrease. Molecular evolutionists correlate the degree of genomic similarity with the amount of time since two species split oﬀ from the same common ancestor; the more similar the genomes, the more recently the two species separated from each other. is is sometimes called the molecular clock model.

Biology Guided Example with Expert Thinking While the genus Saccharomyces is best known for the model and industrial yeast S. cerevisiae, it also includes eight closely related additional species. The repeated isolation of S. cerevisiae from wine, beer, and other fermented beverages, and the difficulty in finding its truly natural habitats, has led to the common view that this species was a product of domestication. However, the unusual degree of shared physiological characteristics among Saccharomyces species along with the recent isolation of S. cerevisiae from a natural environment suggests S. cerevisiae may be a result of natural evolution. In the present work we used a comparative genomics approach and publicly available complete genome sequences of five Saccharomyces species to search for proteins exhibiting molecular patterns of evolution. We used the dN/dS ratio [rate of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN)/rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS)] of the complete Saccharomyces ORFeomes to measure protein divergence and corrected for phylogenetic distance. From this data, we created the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 and searched for genes associated with divergence. Some of the identified genes had been previously associated with adaptation to growth at suboptimal temperatures. This prompted us to examine catabolic fluxes at different temperatures in Saccharomyces species with different growth temperature preferences.
*$%pass: Figure 1 depicts schematically the phylogenetic relationships of the species in the genus Saccharomyces and assigns them to the thermotolerant or cryotolerant Saccharomyces has 9 related Issue: Is the formation of S. cervevisiae due to domestication or natural evolution? There’s a lot of technical jargon here, so to rephrase, the key takeaway is that the researchers used comparative genomics to create the phylogenic tree in After creating the tree, the researchers saw that optimal growth temperature was a pattern that corresponded to the Trend: maximum growth temperature is highest at the top of the tree, and generally descends in order Adapted from Gonçalves, P., Valério, E., Correia, C., de Almeida, J. M., & Sampaio, J. P. (2011). Evidence for divergent evolution of growth temperature preference in sympatric Saccharomyces species. PloS One, 6(6), e20739. Based on the information provided, could temperature have provided the selective pressure for the divergent evolution of Saccharomyces species? e question is asking us if there is support in the passage and ﬁgure for the hypothesis that temperature can explain the divergence of the various Saccharomyces species in the phylogenetic tree. Notice the phrasing of the question—it’s not asking if we have proof that the evolution was due to temperature selection. is analysis is retrospective, so we would have no way to verify whether or not the relationship between growth and temperature leading up to speciation was causal. In paragraph 2, the researchers used fairly complex techniques to analyze the genomes of Saccharomyces species and arranged them in the phylogenetic tree. We don’t need to understand all of the details behind this method. e takeaway is that the phylogeny was generated prior to the analysis of optimal growth temperatures.
*$%pass: e researchers then searched for genes associated with divergence and noticed that some of those genes corresponded to adaptations for growth at nonideal temperatures. Finally, an analysis of the optimal growth temperature for the listed Saccharomyces species gave us a workable pattern—species that are close together on the tree also have very similar optimal growth temperatures. We know from content background that changes in environment can deﬁnitely apply selection pressures strong enough to lead to speciation, or the formation of new species. Recall also that divergent evolution is the development of species with diﬀerent characteristics despite a shared Since temperature is an environmental factor, we can say that based on the given information, there is plausible evidence to support that temperature could have provided the selection pressure for divergent evolution of Saccharomyces species. Genetics and the mechanisms of evolution are becoming increasingly important in medicine, as we unintentionally breed strains of highly resistant bacteria. Antibiotic stewardship, or the use of the appropriate antibiotics only as necessary, is very important as the medical community seeks to preserve the eﬀectiveness of antibiotics. In order to understand and apply the concepts of antibiotic stewardship, one must understand that creating environmental pressures leads to directional selection in microorganisms which can increase the frequency of the resistant phenotype. In this chapter, we covered genetics and mutations, as well as evolution. We also gave you some tools to analyze the biometric (statistical) side of genetics through the use of Punnett squares, recombinant frequencies, and the Hardy–Weinberg equations. It seems ﬁtting to complete this book with a discussion of evolution. You’ve spent hundreds of pages (and hours!) preparing for the MCAT, learning the basics of cell biology, embryogenesis and development, anatomy and physiology, genetics, and evolution.
*$%pass: Our understanding of these topics relies on generations and generations of scientists who came before us, who passed down their knowledge through books, letters, articles, lectures, and —more recently—television, ﬁlm, and popular media. But science is a ﬁeld that is constantly evolving itself. At the beginning of medical school, students are oen told that no more than 25 percent of what they learn during the ﬁrst year will remain true by the time they enter practice. We’re not sure if this statistic actually holds, but it does speak to the importance of staying on top of the latest research—not only as a medical student, but also as a practitioner.

You’ve reviewed the content, now test your knowledge and critical thinking skills by completing a test-like passage set in your online Fundamental Concepts of Genetics Chromosomes contain genes in a linear sequence. Alleles are alternative forms of a gene. A dominant allele requires only one copy to be expressed. A recessive allele requires two copies to be expressed. A genotype is the combination of alleles one has at a given genetic Having two of the same allele is termed homozygous. Having two diﬀerent alleles is termed heterozygous.
*$%pass: Having only one allele is termed hemizygous (such as in male sex A phenotype is the observable manifestation of a genotype. ere are diﬀerent patterns of dominance. Complete dominance occurs when the eﬀect of one allele completely masks the eﬀect of another. Codominance has more than one dominant allele. Incomplete dominance has no dominant alleles; heterozygotes have Penetrance is the proportion of a population with a given genotype who express the phenotype. Expressivity refers to the varying phenotypic manifestations of a given e modern interpretations of Mendel’s laws help explain the inheritance of genes from parent to oﬀspring. Mendel’s ﬁrst law (of segregation) states that an organism has two alleles for each gene, which segregate during meiosis, resulting in gametes carrying only one allele for a trait. Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment) states that the inheritance of one allele does not inﬂuence the probability of inheriting an allele for a diﬀerent trait. Support for DNA as genetic material came through a number of e Griﬃth experiment demonstrated the transforming principle, converting nonvirulent live Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material because degradation of DNA led to a cessation of bacterial transformation. e Hershey–Chase experiment conﬁrmed that DNA is the genetic material because only radiolabeled DNA could be found in Changes in the Gene Pool All of the alleles in a given population constitute the gene pool. Mutations are changes in DNA sequence. Nucleotide mutations include point mutations (the substituting of one nucleotide for another) and frameshi mutations (moving the three- letter transcriptional reading frame). A silent mutation has no eﬀect on the protein. A missense mutation results in the substitution of one amino acid A nonsense mutation results in the substitution of a stop codon for an amino acid.
*$%pass: Insertions and deletions result in a shi in the reading frame, leading to changes for all downstream amino acids. Chromosomal mutations include larger-scale mutations aﬀecting whole segments of DNA. Deletion mutations occur when a large segment of DNA is lost. Duplication mutations occur when a segment of DNA is copied Inversion mutations occur when a segment of DNA is reversed. Insertion mutations occur when a segment of DNA is moved from one chromosome to another. Translocation mutations occur when a segment of DNA is swapped with a segment of DNA from another chromosome. Genetic leakage is a ﬂow of genes between species through hybrid Genetic dri occurs when the composition of the gene pool changes as a result of chance. e founder eﬀect results from bottlenecks that suddenly isolate a small population, leading to inbreeding and increased prevalence of certain homozygous genotypes. Analytical Approaches in Genetics Punnett squares visually represent the crossing of gametes from parents to show relative genotypic and phenotypic frequencies. e parent generation is represented by P; ﬁlial (oﬀspring) generations are represented by F1, F2, and so on in sequence. A monohybrid cross accounts for one gene; a dihybrid cross accounts for two genes. In sex-linked crosses, sex chromosomes are usually used to indicate sex as well as genotype. e recombination frequency (θ) is the likelihood of two alleles being separated during crossing over in meiosis. Genetic maps can be made using recombination frequency as the scale in centimorgans. e Hardy–Weinberg principle states that if a population meets certain criteria (aimed at a lack of evolution), then the allele frequencies will remain constant (Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium). Natural selection states that chance variations exist between individuals and that advantageous variations—those that increase an individual’s ﬁtness for survival or adaptation to the environment— aﬀord the most opportunities for reproductive success.
*$%pass: e modern synthesis model (neo-Darwinism) accounts for mutation and recombination as mechanisms of variation and considers diﬀerential reproduction to be the mechanism for reproductive Inclusive ﬁtness considers an organism’s success to be based on the number of oﬀspring, success in supporting oﬀspring, and the ability of the oﬀspring to then support others; survival of oﬀspring or relatives ensures appearance of genes in subsequent generations. Punctuated equilibrium considers evolution to be a very slow process with intermittent rapid bursts of evolutionary activity. Diﬀerent types of selection lead to changes in phenotypes. Stabilizing selection keeps phenotypes in a narrow range, excluding Directional selection moves the average phenotype toward one Disruptive selection moves the population toward two diﬀerent phenotypes at the extremes and can lead to speciation. Adaptive radiation is the rapid emergence of multiple species from a common ancestor, each of which occupies its own ecological niche. A species is the largest group of organisms capable of breeding to form fertile oﬀspring. Species are reproductively isolated from each other by pre- or postzygotic mechanisms. Two species can evolve with diﬀerent relationship patterns. Divergent evolution occurs when two species sharing a common ancestor become more diﬀerent. Parallel evolution occurs when two species sharing a common ancestor evolve in similar ways due to analogous selection pressures. Convergent evolution occurs when two species not sharing a recent ancestor evolve to become more similar due to analogous selection According to the molecular clock model, the degree of diﬀerence in the genome between two species is related to the amount of time since the two species broke oﬀ from a common ancestor. Answers to Concept Checks 1. A dominant allele is one that requires only one copy for expression. A recessive allele requires two copies for expression. 2.
*$%pass: A homozygous genotype is one in which the two alleles are the same. A heterozygous genotype is one in which the two alleles are diﬀerent. A hemizygous genotype is one in which only one allele is present for a given gene (such as parts of the X chromosome in males). 3. Complete dominance occurs when one allele (the dominant one) completely masks the expression of the other (the recessive one). Codominance occurs when a gene has more than one dominant allele, and two diﬀerent dominant alleles can be expressed simultaneously. Incomplete dominance occurs when a gene has no dominant alleles, and heterozygotes have phenotypes that are intermediate between 4. Penetrance describes the proportion of the population that expresses a phenotype, given a particular genotype. Expressivity describes the diﬀerences in expression (severity, location, and so on) of a phenotype in 5. Mendel’s ﬁrst law (of segregation) most aligns with anaphase I of meiosis. Mendel’s second law (of independent assortment) most aligns with prophase I of meiosis. 1. Silent point mutations occur when one nucleotide is changed for another, but there is no change in the protein coded for by this DNA sequence (due to redundancy in the genetic code). Missense mutations occur when one nucleotide is changed for another, and one amino acid is substituted for another in the ﬁnal protein. Nonsense mutations occur when one nucleotide is changed for another, and a stop codon substitutes for an amino acid in the ﬁnal protein. 2. e two types of frameshi mutations are insertion and deletion 3. Duplication mutations occur when a segment of DNA is copied multiple times in the genome. Inversion mutations occur when a segment of DNA is reversed in the genome.
*$%pass: Translocation mutations occur when a segment of DNA from one chromosome is swapped with a segment of DNA from another chromosome. 4. Genetic leakage requires the formation of a hybrid organism that can then mate with members of one or the other parent species. While hybrids existed historically (especially mules), fertile hybrids were certainly rare before a more modern understanding of genetics (and before a commercial, ﬁnancial, or academic impetus existed to create 5. Genetic dri occurs due to chance, so its eﬀects will be more pronounced with a smaller sample size (in smaller populations). e founder eﬀect occurs when a small group is reproductively isolated from the larger population, allowing certain alleles to take on a higher prevalence in the group than in the rest of the population. Bb × Bb 3 dominant:1 recessive Aa × aa 1 dominant:1 recessive DdEe × ddEE 1 dominant (for D)/dominant (for E): 1 recessive (for D)/dominant (for E) XqX × XY Female: all unaﬀected; male: 1 unaﬀected:1 aﬀected XrX × XrY Both male and female: 1 unaﬀected:1 aﬀected 2. e genes must be in the order SQRT: 3. e criteria for the Hardy–Weinberg principle all imply that the study population is not undergoing evolution; thus, the allele frequencies will remain stable over time. 4. e frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 0.3. e frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.7. e fraction of the population with a heterozygous genotype (2pq) is 2 × 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.42 (42%). e fraction of the population with a homozygous recessive genotype (q2) is (0.7)2 = 0.49 (49%). e fraction of the population with a dominant phenotype (p2 + 2pq) is 0.09 + 0.42 = 0.51 = 51%. 1.
*$%pass: Natural selection states that certain traits that arise from chance are more favorable for reproductive success in a given environment, and that those traits will be passed on to future generations. e modern synthesis model takes natural selection and explains that selection is for speciﬁc alleles, which are passed on to future generations through formation of gametes; the alleles for these favorable traits arise from mutations. Inclusive ﬁtness explains that the reproductive success of an organism is not only due to the number of oﬀspring it creates, but also the ability to care for young (that can then care for others); it explains changes not only at the individual level, but changes based on the survival of the species (and that individual’s alleles within the species, including in other related individuals). Punctuated equilibrium states that for some species, little evolution occurs for a long period, which is interrupted by rapid bursts of evolutionary change. Change to Population Phenotype Loss of extremes, maintenance of phenotype in a small window Movement toward one extreme or the other Movement toward both extremes with loss of the norm; speciation may Two species with a common ancestor become less similar because of diﬀerent evolutionary pressures Two species with a common ancestor remain similar because of similar Two species with no recent common ancestor become more similar because of similar evolutionary pressures 4. A species is deﬁned as the largest group of organisms capable of breeding to form fertile oﬀspring. Science Mastery Assessment Explanations is is a gene-mapping problem. Because there is a correlation between the frequency of recombination and the distance between genes on a chromosome, if we are given the frequencies, we can determine gene order. Remember that one map unit equals 1 percent recombination frequency.
*$%pass: e easiest way to begin is to determine the two genes that are farthest apart; in this case, N and O recombine with a frequency of 18%, so they are 18 map units apart on the chromosome: N and P recombine with 1% frequency, and P and O recombine with 17% frequency, so P must be between N and O: Finally, M and P recombine with 5% frequency, and M and O recombine with 12% frequency, so M must be between P and O: In this dihybrid problem, a doubly recessive individual is crossed with an individual of unknown genotype; this is known as a test cross. e straight- and brown-haired organism has the genotype bbcc and can thus only produce gametes carrying bc. Looking at the F1 oﬀspring, there is a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. e fact that both the dominant and recessive traits are present in the oﬀspring means that the unknown parental genotype must contain both dominant and recessive alleles for each trait. e unknown parental genotype must therefore be BbCc. If you want to double-check the answer, you can work out the Punnett square for the cross BbCc × bbcc: e female in this example is a carrier of two sex-linked traits; based on the genotype, the aﬀected alleles are found on diﬀerent X chromosomes. Drawing out a Punnett square, we see that 25% of the oﬀspring will be female hemophiliacs (XhXh) and 25% will be female carriers of both alleles (XcXh). is question is asking what percentage of females will have a phenotype with no hemophilia or color blindness, which would be half of the females (those who are carriers for both traits). e control parent in a test cross is always recessive.
*$%pass: erefore, if the test parent is phenotypically dominant, yet can provide a recessive allele (as evidenced by the presence of recessive children), then the parent must have both a dominant and recessive allele. erefore, this test parent must be heterozygous. e deﬁnition given here for expressivity is a much better match for deﬁning penetrance (or, really, one minus the penetrance). Expressivity refers to the variable manifestations of a given genotype as diﬀerent phenotypes; the degree to which various phenotypes are expressed. All of the other deﬁnitions given are accurate. Some progeny in the second generation are apparently blends of the parental phenotypes. e orange color is the result of the combined eﬀects of the red and yellow alleles. An allele is incompletely dominant if the phenotype of the heterozygotes is an intermediate of the phenotypes of the homozygotes. To ﬁnd the correct answer, we have to read each choice and eliminate the ones that ﬁt with the modern-day theories of inheritance, which state that the genes that make an organism most ﬁt for its environment will be passed to oﬀspring. is can be seen in (C) and (D), both of which demonstrate that an organism with improved ﬁtness will pass those genes to oﬀspring. (A) mentions a gamete being exposed to mutagens; a zygote created from this gamete would contain any mutations that were present in the egg and would be aﬀected by them. us, (B) must be the correct answer: indeed, acquired characteristics not encoded in the genome should not be passed to oﬀspring according to the modern synthesis model. Darwin’s theory of natural selection argues that chance variations between organisms can help certain organisms survive to reproductive age and produce many oﬀspring, transmitting their variations to the next generation.
*$%pass: us, natural selection would drive the process of evolution forward, enabling the persistence of characteristics that impart an advantage in the environment, eliminating (A). In Darwin’s theory, ﬁtness is measured in terms of reproductive success, as (D) states. rough natural selection, organisms may be separated into groups depending on environmental pressures, and these groups can eventually separate to the point of becoming distinct species, eliminating (C). (B) is the correct answer because the theory of natural selection applies to a population of organisms, not to a particular individual. As such, favorable genetic variations become more and more common from generation to generation, not during the lifetime of an individual. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium exists under certain ideal conditions that, when satisﬁed, allow one to calculate the gene frequencies within a population. e Hardy–Weinberg equation can be applied only under these ﬁve conditions: (1) the population is very large; (2) there are no mutations that aﬀect the gene pool; (3) mating between individuals in the population is random; (4) there is no migration of individuals into or out of the population; (5) the genes in the population are all equally successful at being reproduced. us, from the given choices, only (C) is false: monogamy is not a necessary condition for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. e situation described in the question stem is an example of directional selection. In directional selection, the phenotypic norm of a particular species shis toward an extreme to adapt to a selective pressure, such as an increasingly colder environment. Only those individuals with a thicker layer of fur were able to survive during the Ice Age, thus shiing the A species is deﬁned as the largest group of organisms that can interbreed to produce viable, fertile oﬀspring. erefore, two populations are considered separate species when they can no longer do so.
*$%pass: Let’s use the information provided by the question stem to set up our equations. We are told that the frequency of R equals 30%, and as such, p = 0.30. e frequency of the recessive gene is r = 100% – 30% = 70%; thus, q = 0.70. e frequency of the genotypes, according to the Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium, are given by p2 = RR, 2pq = Rr, and q2 = rr. erefore, the frequency of the genotypes are (0.3)2 = 0.09 = 9% RR, 2 × 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.42 = 42% Rr, and (0.7)2 = 0.49 = 49% Using the information given in the question stem, we can determine that the percentage of the population with blue eyes (genotype bb) = 36% = 0.36 = q2; therefore, q = 0.6. Because this is a Hardy–Weinberg population, we can assume that p + q = 1, so p = 1 0.6 = 0.4. e frequency of heterozygous brown eyes is therefore 2pq = 2 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.48 = 48%. Frameshi mutations include insertions and deletions of nucleotides that change the triplet reading frame. In such a mutation, the amino acid sequence preceding the mutation is normal, yielding a normal N terminal end. However, the triplet reading frame aer the mutation is changed, yielding a drastically diﬀerent C terminal sequence that oen includes a premature stop codon. ese factors together support (D) as the correct answer. Note that nonsense mutations also introduce premature stop codons. However, (C) can be eliminated since a nonsense mutation will create a stop codon directly and will not change the identity of the amino acids before the stop codon.
*$%pass: is scenario—a deletion of some DNA and a duplication of other DNA—would be consistent with a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 21 during development of an egg or sperm. If part of chromosome 21 was swapped with part of chromosome 4, then a gamete resulting from meiosis in this cell would result in a daughter cell with two copies of some of the DNA from 21 and no copies of some of the DNA from 4. erefore, aer fertilization, there would be partial trisomy 21 and partial monosomy 4. While a deletion or insertion could explain one of the ﬁndings, it cannot explain both, eliminating (A) and (B). An inversion should not lead to partial trisomy or partial monosomy because the DNA is simply reversed, eliminating (D). Consult your online resources for additional practice.
